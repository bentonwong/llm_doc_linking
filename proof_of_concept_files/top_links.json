        "moving_content": "Plaintiffs own properties located in Franklin County, Virginia in the area around Boones Mill. MVP holds an easement to construct and maintain a natural gas pipeline across each of the properties. Recently, MVP began construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline on Plaintiffs' properties. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is an approximately 300-mile-long pipeline running from Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Construction of the pipeline is conditioned on, among other things, a permit from the Virginia State Water Control Board (\"SWCB\") pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Clean Water Act. Under the Clean Water Act the SWCB must certify that construction and operation of the pipeline would not violate water quality standards. Moreover, the SWCB's permit made compliance with Virginia's erosion and sediment control statue and regulations a condition of the permit.\nThe first phase of construction of the pipeline requires MVP to clear a 125-foot right-of- way of all vegetation and remove the topsoil. These initial construction activities exposed a layer of reddish clay below the topsoil.\nA steady rain began on May 15, 2018 and continued through May 19, dislodging large amounts of soil and mud from the denuded construction corridor. Soil and mud driven by rainwater runoff flowed down an exposed section of the easement on property adjacent to the Flora property. The soil and mud flowed across Cahas Mountain Road, which borders the Flora property, onto the Floras' hayfield and pasture and continued onto Little Creek, a stream that bisects the Floras' fields. The flow deposited soil and mud in the Floras' fields and in Little Creek. It also deposited about eight inches of mud on Cahas Mountain Road. Laurence Hammack, Construction halted at Mountain Valley Pipeline worksite following severe erosion in Franklin County, The Roanoke Times (May 20, 2018), http://www.roanoke.com/business/constr uction-halted-at-mountain-valley-pipeline-work-site-following-severe/article_2eeebd3a-5007- 56b0-9469-3e381b09b668.html.\nAnother rainstorm passed through the Boones Mill area on May 26 and 27. Rain on those days washed three to four inches of mud and soil from the denuded easements on to the Friths' and Hurts' shared private driveway. The rains also washed mud and soil onto the Frith and Hurt properties, some of which ended up in an unnamed tributary that runs across both of their properties.\nPrior to the rain on May 15 through 19 and May 26 and 27, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (\"DEQ\") stated that erosion and sediment controls on the MVP right-of- way were installed properly but that after the rains on May 15 to 19 the erosion controls \"disappeared.\" Laurence Hammack, Construction halted at Mountain Valley Pipeline worksite following severe erosion in Franklin County, The Roanoke Times (May 20, 2018), http://www.roanoke.com/business/construction-halted-at-mountain-valley-pipeline-work-site- following-severe/article_2eeebd3a-5007-56b0-9469-3e381b09b668.html. Prior to the May 15 to 19 rainstorm, Mr. Flora inspected the easement adjacent to his hayfield and observed that MVP had placed only a few \"silt socks\"1 and some concrete barriers on the easement to control erosion. Both the concrete barriers and the silt socks proved ineffective in holding back the runoff from the easement near the Flora property. In fact, Mr. Flora observed sediment-laden water running around the concrete barriers on the easement.\nThese same controls were used on the easements adjacent to the Frith and Hurt properties. Again, and during a much less intense rainstorm, these erosion controls failed to prevent mud from covering the shared private driveway and the Frith and Hurt properties.\nDEQ has not required MVP to improve the erosion controls on MVP's easements since the rainstorms. DEQ levied no fines or penalties against MVP nor did it issue a formal stop-work order. DEQ has also not ordered MVP to reevaluate the use of certain erosion control mechanisms in light of their recent catastrophic failures and DEQ has not insisted that MVP use more stringent erosion control measures. Instead DEQ has publicly, and wrongly, stated that no sediment from the MVP easements reached any streams. But the eyewitness accounts of Plaintiffs, contemporaneous evidence recorded during the rainstorms, and DEQ internal emails show that sediment runoff into streams near MVP's easements was significant, widespread and nearly uncontrolled. An email from DEQ employee Elizabeth Abe to another DEQ employee Matthew Grant explains that while driving on Brick Church Road in Rocky Mount, Virginia she observed a stream so choked with mud from an MVP easement that water was not flowing through the stream. Ex. A. She also observed that MVP had failed to erect any erosion controls on its easement. Id.\nFor its part MVP has done little, if anything, to remedy the situation that led to large-scale mud deposition on Plaintiffs' properties. As of an inspection on May 28, 2018 MVP had not materially improved the erosion controls at any of the easements near Plaintiffs' properties. Silt fencing2 located on MVP easements near the Flora and Frith properties are riddled with holes and collapsing. Some of the ground underneath the silt fences has eroded away, leaving room for runoff to pass unimpeded underneath the fence. Silt socks on the same easements are only staked to the ground, not embedded in it, such that water may pass freely underneath them as well. Those areas also lack silt socks with enough height to prevent water from spilling over the top of them, especially where some already have mud built up on them. Proof of those conditions will be supported by testimony as to the personal observations of the Plaintiffs on their properties, as supported by photographs, videos, and water samples they took and/or collected. MVP constructed sediment dikes on some of the easements, but the dikes are not compacted and thus they themselves are susceptible to eroding away, completely nullifying their erosion prevention function. Moreover, the dikes are not seeded with grass mats, further adding to the likelihood that they will erode when it next rains. Silt socks placed in gaps in silt fencing and at the outlets of the dikes are secured only by stakes and are undermined by erosion in some places. The next significant rain will exploit the weaknesses in the erosion controls and lead to additional trespasses on Plaintiffs' properties. Neither DEQ nor MVP have addressed these weaknesses and trespasses will continue until MVP is enjoined to remedy those weaknesses.",

        "moving_heading": "I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits",
        "moving_content": "Plaintiffs are likely to succeed the merits of their continuing trespass claim. MVP has shown that it has not been able to control the erosion and deposition of mud and soil from its easements onto Plaintiffs' properties, even during this early stage of construction. Even after its erosion controls failed on two separate occasions, MVP has not attempted to implement tighter controls or even fully repair the mediocre controls it has in place now. MVP's actions make it a near certainty that the next time there is a significant rain event, mud will erode from MVP's easements onto Plaintiffs' properties.\nVirginia common law defines trespass as \"an unauthorized entry onto property which results in interference with the property owner's possessory interests therein.\" Kurpiel v. Hicks, 731 S.E.2d 921, 925 (Va. 2012) (quoting Cooper v. Horn, 448 S.E.2d 403, 406 (Va. 1994)). That means \"a plaintiff must prove an invasion that interfered with the right of exclusive possession of the land . . . that was a direct result of some act committed by the defendant.\" Id.  Plaintiffs here seek only the vindication of the golden rule of property law: \"[t]he law requires that every person so use his own property as not to injure the property of another.\" Cooper v. Horn, 448 S.E.2d 403, 407 (Va. 1994).\nThe power to exclude is one of the most treasured strands in an owner's bundle of property rights. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 435-36 (1982); Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143 (1978) (\"One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others.\"). Violations of this right include trespass. Virginia recognizes the \"general principle of law, [that] every person is entitled to the exclusive and peaceful enjoyment of his own land, and to redress if such enjoyment shall be wrongfully interrupted by another.\" Tate v. Ogg, 195 S.E. 496, 498 (Va. 1938).\nAny physical entry upon the surface of the land constitutes such an invasion, whether the entry is \"a walking upon it, flooding it with water, casting objects upon it, or otherwise.\" W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 13, at 70 (5th ed. 1984). Cooper v. Horn, 248 Va. at 423. Proof of negligence is not necessary. Id. at 424.\nThe Virginia Supreme Court has recognized on multiple occasions that any physical invasion is sufficient to succeed on a trespass claim. Id. This is the case \"whether the entry is a walking upon it, flooding it with water, casting objects upon it, or otherwise.\" Id. A continuing trespass is a trespass that is \"committed by one against another [and] constantly repeated . . . .\" Boerner v. McCallister, 89 S.E.2d 23, 25 (Va. 1955).\nMVP has already committed a trespass against Plaintiffs property rights in their individual properties, and it is extremely likely the MVP will continue to trespass on Plaintiffs' properties when it rains. In fact, MVP has failed to implement erosion controls in a proper manner. MVP has failed to compact its sediment dikes and failed to seed them with grass. MVP also placed silt socks that are inadequate to absorb or redirect the mud-laden flow they receive. Additionally, MVP failed to repair holes in its erosion control mechanisms and erosion underneath those mechanisms and continues to use installation techniques that do not ensure the effectiveness of those controls. DEQ, although lax in its enforcement, is not charged with enforcing trespass law.4 It is, nevertheless, disheartening that DEQ stands idle while MVP refuses to implement effective erosion controls. Further, DEQ's public assessments of the scope of the erosion control failures are undercut by the observations of its own employees. DEQ has shown that by those and other actions that Plaintiffs cannot to rely on the Commonwealth to adequately protect their property rights. Plaintiffs are forced, therefore, to bring this action to ensure that their most fundamental property rights will be protected from MVP's failure to take the care and spend the money necessary to prevent its trespasses.\nAs a result of MVP's slipshod attempt at erosion control and the lack of a plan to remedy the past failures of the same controls currently in place, MVP is nearly certain to continue to deposit mud and soil from its easements onto Plaintiffs' properties when it rains, thus constituting a continuing trespass on Plaintiffs' properties.",

MVP has been unable to prevent mud from being deposited on Plaintiffs' property and has taken few, if any, steps to prevent any future trespass on Plaintiffs' properties.\nViolations of Plaintiffs' property rights constitute an irreparable injury under Virginia law. In holding that an injunction is the appropriate remedy for enforcement of real property rights, the Virginia Supreme Court explained that \"the violation of a real property interest is deemed irreparable and the owner protected in the enjoyment of his property whether such be sentimental or pecuniary.\" Norfolk S. Ry. v. Breeden, 756 S.E.2d 420, 424-25 (Va. 2014) (quoting Levisa Coal Co. v. Consolidation Coal Co., 662 S.E.2d 44, 54 (Va. 2008)). In the case of a continuing trespass, as Plaintiffs claim here, the Defendant's were in compliance with DEQ's requirements, which it is not, such compliance would not affect its duty to also comply with its common law obligations.\ncontinuing trespass may be enjoined even though each individual act of trespass is in itself trivial, or the damage is trifling, nominal or insubstantial, and despite the fact that no single trespass causes irreparable injury. The injury is deemed irreparable and the owner protected in the enjoyment of his property whether such be sentimental or pecuniary.\nLevisa Coal, 662 S.E.2d at 54 (quoting Boerner, 89 S.E.2d at 25). This is so because \"where an injury by one against another is being constantly repeated, so that the complainant's remedy at law requires the bringing of successive actions, the legal remedy is inadequate, and the trespass will be prevented in equity by an injunction, the prevention of a multiplicity of actions at law being one of the special grounds of equity jurisdiction.\" Boerner, 89 S.E.2d at 25. MVP's lack of effective erosion controls will likely result in future injuries to Plaintiffs' properties each time an appreciable amount of rain falls. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' injuries can only be remedied by an injunction barring future trespasses by MVP.",

W. Law Rev. 187, 188 (1992). It does Plaintiffs grievous harm for MVP to continue to infringe on this most basic of rights.\nBy contrast, MVP \"will suffer no harm by being enjoined from doing what the law already prohibits.\" Solis v. Manalapan Mining Co., No. 10-115-GFVT, 2010 WL 2197534, at *6 (E.D. Ky. May 27, 2010). An injunction here would prevent MVP from trespassing on Plaintiffs' properties by requiring more stringent erosion controls.

In determining that potential legal remedies would be inadequate, the Court in Peek relief upon the fact that the plaintiff's business \"would be long loss before her claims against the [defendant] were adjudicated.\"  367 S.C. at 457, 626 S.E.2d at 38.\nSimilarly, the harm that will result to Plaintiffs from the continued construction of the building will be immediate and substantial.  Even ultimate success on the merits may prove a little more than a hollow victory, unless a court requires the building to be destroyed.  While a court may award monetary damages for loss of profits, in most cases however, \"injunctive relief is a better remedy because it allows for continuation of the business operations pending a final adjudication on the merits.  Id.

Real property is a unique interest as no two properties are alike, or to such interest is not readily measurable or fully compensable in damages.  See Kmart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., supra.\nAbsent intervention from this Court, construction of the building will permanently and materially obstruct the view of the Ingles store from adjacent roads and affect Sky King's rights under the Lease and future development of the shopping center.  As a result, Plaintiffs' careful planning regarding the location access and view of the Ingles store and other improvements in the shopping center will all be for naught.  Plaintiffs will not be able to maintain the center view site line, which is of major importance to it in selecting a building site for Ingles and most other potential future tenants. Furthermore, Plaintiffs will not benefit from its careful planning and having restrictions placed on the property so as to not impede the view of the Ingles store, which it bargained for but will not receive.  The obstruction will impair the value of its store, its ability to attract new customers, and the value of the premises under future leases for the space.  These injuries satisfy application of the irreparable harm standard.  It is essential, therefore, that the Court enjoin Defendants from continuing construction on the building to obstruct the view of the Ingles store, and which is in contravention of the restrictive covenants, which were placed on the property by virtue of, inter alia, the Declaration.",

Prior to beginning construction, Maria was on notice that it could not construct one building on the two parcels it purportedly owns.  The Declaration of Reciprocal Easement, filed in the RMC Office on June 10, 2002, provides as follows:\n5.3 Restrictions Relating to Development. Development and use restrictions shall limit the construction to be performed on Parcels 1, 2, and 3 to the construction of one building of one story and no more than twenty-four (24) feet in height in the locations and with the requisite parking spaces, shown on \"Exhibit E\" attached hereto.\nThus, the Declaration by its terms limits construction on Parcels 1, 2, or 3 to one building per parcel. Defendant Maria purportedly owns only Parcels 2 and 3; therefore, any argument that this restriction contemplated one building on multiple parcels is inapposite. Such a construction would make development of Parcel 1, which is not contiguous with Parcels 2 and 3, completely impossible. In addition, Restriction 5.3 references an attached \"Exhibit E.\"  Exhibit E (which allegedly was not attached to the filed document) clearly delineates the fact that the Declarationlimits development of Parcels 1, 2, or 3 to one building per parcel, and sets forth the location of each potential building.  Even if the exhibit was not attached to the Declaration, Defendant Maria was on notice to inquire about Exhibit E's contents.\nIn the context of a real estate transaction, constructive or inquiry notice arises when a party becomes aware or should have become aware of certain facts, which, if investigated, will reveal the claim of another.  A party will be charged by operation of law with all knowledge that an investigation by a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser would have revealed.  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 828 S.E.2d 869 (2008).  Here, the Declaration was a matter of public record.  The Declaration specifically indicated there were restrictions as to construction on Parcels 1, 2, and 3 and referenced a specific exhibit.  \"[A] purchaser cannot carelessly disregard record notice of potential encumbrances, even when the adequacy of notice is questionable.\" South Carolina Tax Commission v. Belk, 266 S.C. 539, 544, 225 S.E.2d 177, 180 (1976).  A prudent purchaser would have made further inquiry as to the contents of Exhibit E.  Exhibit E, which is a depiction of Parcels 1, 2, and 3 taken directly from the approved site plan attached to the amendment to the Lease, shows clearly that a building spanning more than one lot is not allowed.  Thus, Defendant is charged with this knowledge, which one simple inquiry would have revealed.\nMoreover, Defendant had knowledge of the Declaration before construction began, as its counsel was furnished a copy of the Declaration, as well as Exhibit E by counsel for Plaintiffs.",

        "response_content": "In Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (\"Plaintiffs' Memorandum\"), Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had constructive notice of the restrictive covenants referenced in the REA.  In the context of a real estate transaction, constructive notice \"often is grounded in an examination of the public record because it is the proper recording of documents asserting an interest or claim in real property which gives constructive notice to the world.\"  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 119, 628 S.E.2d 869, 876 (2006).  However, in some situations, constructive notice can arise \"when a party becomes aware or should have become aware of certain facts which, if investigated, would reveal the claim of another.\"  Id. at 120, 628 S.E.2d at 876.  In such circumstances, South Carolina caselaw has emphasized that the standard which applies is the type of investigation that would be conducted by a \"reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser.\" Id. at 120, 628 S.E.2d at 876.\nAs set forth in Plaintiffs' Memorandum, the REA includes the following provision: 5.3   Restrictions Relating to Development.  Development and use restrictions shall limit the construction to be performed on Parcels 1, 2, and 3 to the construction of one building of one story and no more than twenty-four (24) feet in height in the locations and with the requisite parking spaces, shown on Exhibit \"E\" attached hereto.\nThe filed REA, however, contained no attached Exhibit \"E\" and therefore Exhibit \"E\" was not, and could not be found when the Akkarys performed a title search of the public record prior to purchasing the Subject Property from Jaylin Spartanburg.  Plaintiffs' Memorandum suggests that the Akkarys performed no further inquiry; however, this is far from the truth.  As set forth above, the Purchase Contract required Jaylin Spartanburg, as the seller, to provide copies of the documents in Jaylin Spartanburg's possession that pertained to the Subject Property.  In conjunction with the closing on the Subject Property (the \"Closing\"), the Akkarys' closing attorney interacted with Jaylin Spartanburg and its broker in an effort to obtain all relevant documents pertinent to the transaction.  The Akkarys' inquiry was more than reasonable given that Jaylin Spartanburg was not only the Seller under the Purchase Contract but also the Declarant under the REA.  In short, Jaylin Spartanburg was in the best position to have knowledge of any restrictions or limitations related to the Subject Property.   Despite the Akkarys' inquiry, Exhibit \"E\" was never provided to the Akkarys or their attorney prior to the Closing nor did they ever receive confirmation of the existence of the same.  Additionally, the Seller's Affidavit, Certification and Acknowledgment, executed by Jaylin Spartanburg as part of the Closing, specifically provides that there are no liens, encumbrances, or easements against the Subject Property that were not disclosed on the closing statement, the deed and/or satisfied at closing.19\nThe Akkarys clearly performed the type of inquiry that would be conducted by a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser of commercial real estate.  They conducted a full title examination prior to purchasing the Subject Property and, through their attorney, followed up with Jaylin Spartanburg and/or its broker by requesting Jaylin Spartanburg and/or its broker to provide all pertinent documentation associated with the transaction.  The Akkarys took those steps that would be expected in such a circumstance.  To rule in favor of Plaintiffs on the constructive notice issue would change the landscape of real estate transactions in South Carolina and would be inconsistent with our system of record notice.20\nConversely, if anyone has failed to do their duty in this matter, it is not the Akkarys, but Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' predecessors in title.  Plaintiffs and/or their predecessors in title failed to secure the rights they now assert, failed to properly record the documentation necessary to put the public on notice of said rights and also failed to act in a timely manner once they knew or should have known of the sale of the Subject Property.  Specifically, the failures of Plaintiffs and/or its predecessors in title include but are not limited to the following:\na. failing to obtain and/or record an enforceable right of first refusal with regard to the Subject Property; b. failing to obtain and/or record an enforceable memorandum of its lease to provide notice to the world of its rights; c. failing to acquire the Subject Property from Jaylin Spartanburg despite having actual and/or constructive knowledge of Jaylin Spartanburg's desire to sell the same; d. failing to act in a timely manner after having actual or constructive notice of the Akkarys' purchase of the Subject Property; e. failing to act in accordance with the terms of the REA; f. failing to ensure that the purported Exhibit \"E\" was attached to and recorded with the REA; and g. failing to provide the Akkarys and/or their closing attorney with a copy of the purported \"Exhibit E\" prior to closing, after being asked by the Akkarys to provide all relevant documents associated with the closing.\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.",

The Akkarys acted as a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser would act and therefore satisfied their duties under the doctrine of constructive notice.  To hold that the Akkarys had constructive notice of the applicable restrictions under such circumstances would have the effect of altering South Carolina's well-established law of record notice.  Purchasers of  residential and commercial real estate would not be entitled to rely on disclosures made by sellers and would be forced to exhibit a level of scrutiny that would go far beyond the current standards of real estate practice in this state.  Such a ruling could potentially have a chilling effect on the purchase of real estate, as buyers could feel that they might end up facing the burden of any errors or omissions made by the Seller during the closing process.  It would also send a message to sellers of real estate in this state that they can afford to be lax in the preparation and recordation of their documents, as they will ultimately be protected from their own negligence at the buyer's expense.\nIt is also incredibly significant that there are currently eight (8) vacant bays in the Plaintiffs' Shopping Center.   Plaintiffs are aware of this fact and are now seeking this Court's protection from legal and fair competition.  Defendant strongly believes that Plaintiffs' desire to restrict legal and fair competition in the Shopping Center is the motivation behind Plaintiffs' Motion and that this represents a misuse, or even an abuse of process.

Accordingly, this Court should enforce the arbitration provisions of the Dealership Agreement, and either dismiss this action or stay this proceeding pending the outcome of the required arbitration.\nMoreover, assuming, without conceding, that Maine law applies to this dispute, that conclusion is consistent with Maine\u201fs Uniform Arbitration Act, which provides that a written contract to submit to arbitration is \"valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"  14 M.R.S. \u00a7 5927.  Because Plaintiff here has never alleged that the Dealership Agreement should be revoked-and, indeed, predicates its claims on the existence of the Dealership Agreement-there is no basis under the Maine Uniform Arbitration Act for not enforcing the parties\u201f arbitration agreement.

Doubts should be resolved in favor of arbitration\").\nMoreover, any argument by Plaintiff that Maine law precludes enforcement of the Dealership Agreement\u201fs arbitration clause is foreclosed by Federal preemption principles.  The FAA does not contain any express preemption provisions and does not indicate a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.

Finally, Officer Brandreth is entitled to qualified immunity from the Fourth Amendment claim as probable cause was at least arguable, particularly where Officer Brandreth was following the recommendation of his superiors.\nOfficer Brandreth did not violate Ms. Petrello's First Amendment rights.  She was not prohibited from showing her sign to persons traveling on the road.  The charge came when she caused a vehicle to stop with a green light, thereby causing a traffic hazard.  That was a violation under a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and was a reasonable time, place and manner restriction on the Plaintiff's First Amendment rights, was content neutral, and did not impair her from conveying any message that she wished to convey.\nTo the extent that the Plaintiff intended to plead a claim for violation of Equal Protection as to Officer Bandreth, the plaintiff has failed to state a claim, as the driver of the Cadillac and the Plaintiff were not similarly situated.",

Where an \"officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen ... a 'seizure' has occurred.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968); see also United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 553 (1980).  In effect, a person has been \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.  Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure . . . would be the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.\nMendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554 (emphasis added).  A seizure may violate the Fourth Amendment even if it does not constitute an arrest or its equivalent.  Such seizures do not violate the Fourth Amendment where the officer, based \"on a reasonable and articulable suspicion,\" makes the stop to \"investigate suspected past or present criminal activity.\"  United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996)); see also Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"When there is probable cause for an arrest, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is not offended.\").  Put another way, a seizure under Terry violates the Fourth Amendment where there is no \"reasonable and articulable suspicion\" that the person has or is engaging in criminal activity. Here, Defendant, as he must, concedes that Plaintiff was seized.  Plaintiff also claims that the summons, itself, lacked probable cause.\nUnder the disorderly conduct statute, \"[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct if: ... He or she: ... (c) Obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic on any public street or sidewalk or the entrance to any public building.\").  See RSA 644:2(II)(c) (emphasis added). Consistent with the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, video Plaintiff produced in discovery reveals that Defendant's detention of Plaintiff was based solely on (i) Plaintiff's speech to passing motorists asking them to make a donation and (ii) a motorist's reaction to her speech, which Defendant claimed was obstructing the roadway.  According to the video, Plaintiff was stopped \"[b]ased on your behavior ... by being out here with a sign panhandling for money, having a car stop, and then not allowing the second car who was not able to get through the intersection that it should have ....\"  See Exhibit 1 (emphasis added).2  Thus, the question here is whether it would be objectively reasonable for Defendant Officer Brandreth to suspect that a peaceful panhandler soliciting motorists from a public place is \"obstructing\" traffic simply when a car slows down or stops in response to the panhandler's specific speech asking for a donation.\nAs is clear by using both common sense and examining the disorderly conduct statute's plain terms, a peaceful panhandler soliciting donations from motorists in a public place is not obstructing traffic, regardless of how the motorist responds.  According to Black's Law Dictionary, to \"obstruct\" means \"[t]o block up; to interpose obstacles; to render impassable; to fill with barriers or impediments; as to obstruct a road or way.\"  See \"Obstruct,\" Black's Law Dictionary, available at http://thelawdictionary.org/obstruct/.  A peaceful panhandler in a public place engaging in speech directed at motorists is not \"blocking,\" \"interposing obstacles,\" \"rendering impassable\" or \"filling with barriers or impediments\" in a roadway.  To the extent anyone is obstructing a roadway, it would be the motorist who makes the independent, intervening decision to slow down or stop his car and make a donation-not the panhandler who is simply conveying a peaceful message adjacent to the roadway.  Under Defendant's theory, a teenager on a public place adjacent to a roadway would be criminally liable for disorderly conduct when a motorist slows down in response to the teenager's speech simply asking (whether it be verbally or through a sign) motorists to pull over or make a turn to buy lemonade or have their car washed.  Like Plaintiff's speech, this speech is obviously not obstructive where a speaker is not impeding someone's right of way and not causing the motorist to take evasive action.  See Human v. Colarusso, No. 13-cv-296-SM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4866, at *4, 12, 2015 DNH 012 (D.N.H. Jan. 15, 2015) (noting that plaintiff \"obstructed pedestrian traffic at that intersection\" when he \"forc[ed] people to walk around his display to access the crosswalk\"). Indeed, under Defendant's extreme \"but/for\" causation theory, the owner of a sign on a median or a billboard telling a motorist to turn left on a single-lane road to enter a business could create an obstruction on a roadway when the driver slows down or even stops to make the turn in response to the speech.  Under this example, the speaker-here, the sign or billboard owner-would have violated the law simply because of how the motorist responded to his or her protected speech.  As a matter of common sense, this is obviously incorrect because (i) the speaker is not in the road doing the obstructing and (ii) there is an intervening act that severs any semblance of causation-namely, the free will of the motorist deciding to slow down or stop.3\nThe crux of Defendant's argument seems to be that he is entitled to qualified immunity because the term \"obstruction\" has not been defined by case law.  While it is true that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not interpreted the term \"obstruction,\" the qualified immunity analysis \"does not require a case directly on point.\"  Glik, 655 F.3d at 81.  A regulation or statute is sufficient in determining the contours of a legal right.  Put another way, the command of a statute is itself \"clearly established law.\"  See Santana v. Calderon, 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless (1) the facts alleged show the defendants' conduct violated a constitutional right, and (2) the contours of this right are 'clearly established' under then-existing law so that a reasonable officer would have known that his conduct was unlawful.\"); see also Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194 n.12 (1984) (\"officials become liable for damages only to the extent that there is a clear violation of the statutory rights that give rise to the cause of action for damages\") (emphasis added); Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 733 (2002) (guards' conduct in twice handcuffing the plaintiff to a hitching post to sanction him for disorderly conduct violated clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known; decision based, in part, on regulation authority).  Of course, the most egregious violations of rights may not engender legal opinions or may not even happen at all.  This is why statutes and regulations can, by themselves, define the contours of legal rights and prevent qualified immunity when these clearly- established rights are violated.\nFinally, determining whether qualified immunity exists here is also premature.  For example, Defendant's Motion cannot be fully examined without further discovery into how the Manchester Police Department has historically interpreted the disorderly conduct law applied against Plaintiff. To the extent Officer Brandreth's interpretation is not one that he or the Department has historically applied, that would tend to support the fact that the Officer's application of this statute is novel and deviated from its plain terms.  The evidence in this case is likely to reveal-as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint and its exhibits-that this interpretation is entirely new and was only recently adopted in approximately 2015.  Discovery may also reveal that Officer Brandreth has never applied his interpretation to, for example, teenagers on the side of the road soliciting motorists to buy an item or have their car washed-facts which would further demonstrate how this interpretation as applied to panhandlers is a selective distortion of an otherwise clear statute.

As the Supreme Court has said, qualified immunity provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who normally violate the law. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).  The aim is to protect those who might otherwise be deterred from official duties for fear that an innocent mistake would create personal liability. Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1997). . The protection of qualified immunity applies regardless of whether the government officials' error is a mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009).\nOrdinarily, qualified immunity inquiry is a two part test.  A court must decide:  (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the Plaintiff make up a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) if so, whether the right was clearly established at the time of the Defendant's alleged violation. Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 269.\nThe Court's typical approach is to first determine whether there was a constitutional right violated, and then secondly, determine whether that right was clearly established under the law. Pearson, 555 U.S. at 232.  However, in Pearson, the Supreme Court recognized that in many cases it would be more useful to first determine whether the right was clearly established at all so that courts could avoid attempting to make uncertain assumptions about state law. Id. at 238. Determining whether the law is clearly established follows the Court's general policy preference to avoid passing on a constitutional question if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. Id. at 241.  The Court noted that there will be cases in which a court will rather quickly and easily decide that there was no violation of clearly established law before having to turn to the more difficult question of whether the relevant facts make out a constitutional question at all.

        "moving_content": "Under the second part of the qualified immunity test, Officer Brandreth did not violate clearly established law.  In order to prevail on this part of the test, the Plaintiff would have to show that RSA 644:2(II)(c) had previously been interpreted in this jurisdiction (or at the least that a similar statute was interpreted by a court that controls this jurisdiction, i.e., the First Circuit) that a situation where an individual successfully causing moving traffic to stop against a green light, thereby causing an obstruction to traffic behind it, did not fall within the meaning of this statute.  Absent such a finding, it cannot be said that there is any clearly established law that holds Officer Brandreth's interpretation of the statute was unreasonable.  Accordingly, the Plaintiff's proposition-that RSA 644:2(II)(c) does not apply to a person who attempts and succeeds in getting traffic to stop against a green traffic light and then physically interacts with the driver--is not clearly established.\nThere is an obvious public safety interest in curtailing this specific activity, where the Plaintiff has caused a vehicle to stop against the prevailing traffic pattern. Obviously, this could cause a traffic accident where the vehicles behind would note the green light and assume the vehicle in front of them was going to proceed uninterrupted, and could also cause an accident by the vehicle behind becoming frustrated in trying to make the light and pulling out into a lane where another vehicle could come upon it.  This is an obvious, reasonable exercise of the municipal police power.  The court can take judicial notice of the time and expense that municipalities spend on traffic patterns, traffic lights and that the State has established substantial \"rules of the road\" to promote traffic flow. See for example, note the \"Traffic Control Standards, Statutes & Policies\" (TCSSP), used to determine where traffic lights are necessary. Bergeron v. City of Manchester, 140 N.H. 417, 419, (1995).\nThe Plaintiff attached to her Complaint as Exhibit A documents from the Manchester Police Department pursuant to a Right-to-Know law request. Within those documents at page 37 of the Exhibit is an email from Captain James Soucy of the Community Policing Division to all Officers with the subject \"Panhandlers.\" One section of the email advises officers as follows:\n\"Simply put, if a panhandler does any of the following - you may use these options:\nAction: Panhandler causes traffic to slow or become impeded when accepting donations -even if they are not standing or step into a public way. Officer's Option: Charge with DOC 644:2 (c) Obstructing vehicular traffic in any public street.\"\nBased on Plaintiff's allegations and the documents attached to Plaintiff's Complaint, Officer Brandreth was instructed to use this statute as one way of controlling the interaction between panhandlers and moving vehicles. A reasonable police officer in his place who had received such an instruction from his superior officers has an additional reason to believe that there was no clearly established law that prohibited using this statute to curtail interaction between pedestrians and motor vehicles, such as that between Ms. Petrello and the Cadillac which had the green light on the day in question.\nThe Plaintiff's argument seems to be that she had to have her feet planted in the roadway to be obstructing traffic, although there is no dispute that she reached out into the roadway to physically interact with a vehicle. One can think of several scenarios where an individual could be charged under the statute, for example, a person brandishing a toy gun to try to cause a car to stop, pretending to be injured by the side of the road, and other actions which does not require the person to actually step out into the road. There is no language in the statute that requires that a subject's feet must actually be planted in the road, and there is certainly no case law that establishes that interpretation. Under this very specific factual scenario-the Plaintiff physically interacting with moving traffic and causing a vehicle to stop against a green light-there is no clearly established law to say that Officer Brandreth's enforcement of the statute in these circumstances violated clearly established law.",

Though the \"clearly established\" inquiry does \"not require a case directly on point,\" Glik, 655 F.3d at 84, basic First Amendment principles-along with case law from the United States Supreme Court, First Circuit, and other circuits-demonstrate the protected nature of Plaintiff's speech on June 3, 2015, regardless of the terms of the disorderly conduct statute.  See id. at 81 (\"Basic First Amendment principles, along with case law from this and other circuits, answer that question unambiguously in the affirmative.\").\nAs Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, the directive, and Defendant's own actions under the directive make clear, Defendant targeted Plaintiff's panhandling speech by criminalizing it solely based on the message it conveys and the motorist's response to it.  See Am. Compl. \u00b635- 36., 40, 43, 70.  The directive, itself, focuses exclusively on panhandlers in a content-based fashion, therefore rendering it presumptively unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny analysis.  See, e.g., Thayer v. City of Worcester, 144 F. Supp. 3d 218, 233-34 (D. Mass. 2015) (ordinance targeting panhandling speech-namely, speech seeking an immediate donation of money or another thing of value-was content based and triggered strict scrutiny).  As is obvious from the facts alleged and the directive itself, if a motorist slows down to give a stranger a dollar unsolicited, the stranger would not be issued a summons because he is not a panhandler.  It was only when Plaintiff asked for a donation as a panhandler in a public place did Defendant elect to criminalize her speech after a motorist reacted to it.  Any officer should know that such targeting is improper under the First Amendment.\nIt is also clear that solicitation, panhandling, and begging are constitutionally-protected forms of speech. In Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, the United States Supreme Court struck down an ordinance that prohibited solicitation by certain organizations, holding that \"charitable appeals for funds, on the street or door to door, involve a variety of speech interests-communication of information, the dissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and the advocacy of causes-that are within the protection of the First Amendment.\"  444 U.S. 620, 632 (1980).  As the Court explained, \"solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular views on economic, political, or social issues,\" and \"without solicitation the flow of such information and advocacy would likely cease.\"  Id. at 620-21.\nIn the decades since Village of Schaumburg, courts have repeatedly reached the same result in the panhandling context.  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has observed:\nBegging frequently is accompanied by speech indicating the need for food, shelter, clothing, medical care or transportation.  Even without particularized speech, however, the presence of an unkempt and disheveled person holding out his or her hand or a cup to receive a donation itself conveys a message of need for support and assistance.\nwas impermissibly content-based).  Other courts, including those within the First Circuit, have agreed.  See, e.g., Clatterbuck v. City of Charlottesville, 708 F.3d 549, 556 (4th Cir. 2013) (plaintiff's complaint challenging no-solicitation zone survives motion to dismiss); Ayres v. City of Chicago, 125 F.3d 1010, 1015-16 (7th Cir. 1997) (granting injunction against ordinance forbidding the peddling of any merchandise, except newspapers, on either public property or certain private property in districts designated by the city council); Thayer, 144 F. Supp. 3d at 232 (\"Soliciting contributions is expressive activity that is protected by the First Amendment.\"); McLaughlin v. City of Lowell, 140 F. Supp. 3d 177, 184 (D. Mass. 2015) (\"Solicitations of money by organized charities are within the protection of the First Amendment.\") (internal quotations omitted); Pindak v. Dart, 125 F. Supp. 3d 720, 766 (N.D. Ill. 2015) (rejecting qualified immunity, and explaining that \"[t]he relevant case law clearly establishes Plaintiffs' First Amendment right to engage in ... panhandling\"); Speet v. Schuette, 889 F. Supp. 2d 969, 978 (W.D. Mich. 2012) (holding unconstitutional Michigan statute prohibiting begging), aff'd, 726 F.3d 867 (6th Cir. 2013); Wilkinson v. State, 860 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1288-90 (D. Utah 2012) (striking down statute stating that, in multiple circumstances, a person \"may not sit, stand, or loiter on or near a roadway for the purpose of soliciting from the occupant of a vehicle\"); Benefit v. City of Cambridge, 679 N.E.2d 184, 188 (Mass. 1997) (concluding that \"there is no distinction of constitutional dimension between soliciting funds for oneself and for charities and therefore that peaceful begging constitutes communicative activity protected by the First Amendment\").  In Benefit, for example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down a Massachusetts statute which made it a crime to beg without a license, finding that there was no compelling state interest justifying such a broad restriction on the right to freedom of speech:\nThe statute intrudes not only on the right of free communication, but it also implicates and suppresses an even broader right-the right to engage fellow human beings with the hope of receiving aid and compassion .... If such a basic transaction as peacefully requesting or giving casual help to the needy may be forbidden in all such places, then we may belong to the government that regulates us and not the other way around.\nBenefit, 679 N.E.2d at 190 (emphasis added).\nPlaintiff's speech is undoubtedly afforded First Amendment protection given that it occurred in a public place with no allegation that Plaintiff ever stepped in the roadway.  See McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2529 (2014) (\"It is no accident that public streets and sidewalks have developed as venues for the exchange of ideas.  Even today, they remain one of the few places where a speaker can be confident that he is not simply preaching to the choir.  With respect to other means of communication, an individual confronted with an uncomfortable message can always turn the page, change the channel, or leave the Web site.  Not so on public streets and sidewalks.\"); Doyle v. Comm'r, N.H. Dep't. of Resources & Economic Dev., 163 N.H. 215, 223 (2012) (\"Traditional public forums are fundamental to the continuing vitality of our democracy, for time out of mind, [they] have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.  As such, government entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private speech in [traditional public forums].\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nSpeech directed at motorists from public places-like the speech engaged in by Plaintiff- is also constitutionally protected regardless of how motorists react to the speech.  This includes speech soliciting donations, as well as speech asking motorists to pull over, slow down, or honk. This clear principle was echoed in the recent First Circuit decision Cutting v. City of Portland, 802 F.3d 79 (1st Cir. 2015).  In that case, the First Circuit struck down a content-neutral ordinance that indiscriminately banned virtually all expressive activity in all of Portland's median strips.  This ordinance was motivated by a desire to restrict panhandling directed at motorists.  In rejecting the ordinance on First Amendment grounds, the First Circuit specifically explained how a median ban could impact protected panhandling speech, noting that one of the plaintiffs was a panhandler \"who uses medians to panhandle\" but who \"finds sidewalks so useless for her purposes that she now takes a bus to a different town in order to panhandle from medians.\"  Id. at 89.  Here, the directive's content-based nature and lack of tailoring are patently obvious, and make this a much easier case than Cutting.  The directive upon which Defendant apparently relies focuses only on \"panhandling\"-namely, speech designed to solicit a donation.  See Def.'s Br. at 3.  And, as McCullen and Cutting make clear-cases in which content-neutral laws were struck down for lack of tailoring-a far more tailored approach here would be to address the motorist's conduct, not the speech of a speaker in a public place.4\nThus, by targeting only the pedestrian asking for money-rather than other pedestrians impacting motorists or drivers who are actually in the roadway-Defendant Officer Brandreth violated Plaintiff's clearly-established First Amendment rights, regardless of whether he was following Department policy or not.  It is axiomatic that a person's speech-including the speech of panhandlers-cannot be criminalized simply because of someone's reaction to it, even if that reaction is a motorist deciding to slow down in a roadway.  See, e.g., Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936 (9th Cir. 2011) (anti-solicitation ordinance that bars individuals from \"stand[ing] on a street or highway and solicit[ing], or attempt[ing] to solicit, employment, business, or contributions from an occupant of any motor vehicle\" is unconstitutional on its face); Valle Del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 709 F.3d 808, 814 (9th Cir. 2013) (striking down law that made it unlawful for a motor vehicle occupant to hire or attempt to hire a person for work at another location from a stopped car that impeded traffic, or for a person to be hired in such a manner; while acknowledging \"that Arizona has a real and substantial interest in traffic safety,\" holding that \"Arizona, however, has failed to justify a need to serve that interest through targeting and penalizing day labor solicitation that blocks traffic, rather than directly targeting those who create traffic hazards without reference to their speech, as currently proscribed under the State's preexisting traffic laws\") (emphasis added); Goedert v. City of Ferndale, 596 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1028 (E.D. Mich. 2008) (striking down city's ordinances that, in part, prohibited the display of signs asking motorists to \"honk\" their horns to express their support for the demonstrators).  Courts have repeatedly held that the government should not suppress the speech of a speaker because of the response to the speech, but rather should address the reaction to the speech (here, the actions of the motorist).  See, e.g., Van Arnam v. GSA, 332 F. Supp. 2d 376, 402 (D. Mass. 2004) (\"Courts have held that when the cost to the speaker of using the forum location is made to depend not only on expenses for which she may be directly responsible, but also for the expenses potentially created by counterdemonstrators and others over whom she has no control, an unconstitutional 'heckler's veto' can be created.\") (citing Forsyth Cty. v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 134-35 (1992)).  For these reasons, Defendant Motion should be denied as to Plaintiff's First Amendment claim.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Theresa M. Petrello respectfully requests that this Court deny Defendant Officer Ryan J. Brandreth's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.5",

The court found that although the ordinance was content neutral, it was not narrowly tailored to limit its effects on free speech and was therefore found unconstitutional.

She was ticketed under a very narrow set of facts i.e. physically interacting with a motor vehicle which had the green light and causing it to stop against a green light.

        "response_content": "Defendant's actions in detaining and citing Plaintiff-who was peacefully panhandling and not stepping in the roadway-violated clearly-established statutory law, and therefore violated Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights.\nThe Fourth Amendment prevents unreasonable seizures of persons.  Where an \"officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen ... a 'seizure' has occurred.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968); see also United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 553 (1980).  In effect, a person has been \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.  Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure . . . would be the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.\nMendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554 (emphasis added).  A seizure may violate the Fourth Amendment even if it does not constitute an arrest or its equivalent.  Such seizures do not violate the Fourth Amendment where the officer, based \"on a reasonable and articulable suspicion,\" makes the stop to \"investigate suspected past or present criminal activity.\"  United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996)); see also Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"When there is probable cause for an arrest, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is not offended.\").  Put another way, a seizure under Terry violates the Fourth Amendment where there is no \"reasonable and articulable suspicion\" that the person has or is engaging in criminal activity. Here, Defendant, as he must, concedes that Plaintiff was seized.  Plaintiff also claims that the summons, itself, lacked probable cause.\nUnder the disorderly conduct statute, \"[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct if: ... He or she: ... (c) Obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic on any public street or sidewalk or the entrance to any public building.\").  See RSA 644:2(II)(c) (emphasis added). Consistent with the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, video Plaintiff produced in discovery reveals that Defendant's detention of Plaintiff was based solely on (i) Plaintiff's speech to passing motorists asking them to make a donation and (ii) a motorist's reaction to her speech, which Defendant claimed was obstructing the roadway.  According to the video, Plaintiff was stopped \"[b]ased on your behavior ... by being out here with a sign panhandling for money, having a car stop, and then not allowing the second car who was not able to get through the intersection that it should have ....\"  See Exhibit 1 (emphasis added).2  Thus, the question here is whether it would be objectively reasonable for Defendant Officer Brandreth to suspect that a peaceful panhandler soliciting motorists from a public place is \"obstructing\" traffic simply when a car slows down or stops in response to the panhandler's specific speech asking for a donation.\nAs is clear by using both common sense and examining the disorderly conduct statute's plain terms, a peaceful panhandler soliciting donations from motorists in a public place is not obstructing traffic, regardless of how the motorist responds.  According to Black's Law Dictionary, to \"obstruct\" means \"[t]o block up; to interpose obstacles; to render impassable; to fill with barriers or impediments; as to obstruct a road or way.\"  See \"Obstruct,\" Black's Law Dictionary, available at http://thelawdictionary.org/obstruct/.  A peaceful panhandler in a public place engaging in speech directed at motorists is not \"blocking,\" \"interposing obstacles,\" \"rendering impassable\" or \"filling with barriers or impediments\" in a roadway.  To the extent anyone is obstructing a roadway, it would be the motorist who makes the independent, intervening decision to slow down or stop his car and make a donation-not the panhandler who is simply conveying a peaceful message adjacent to the roadway.  Under Defendant's theory, a teenager on a public place adjacent to a roadway would be criminally liable for disorderly conduct when a motorist slows down in response to the teenager's speech simply asking (whether it be verbally or through a sign) motorists to pull over or make a turn to buy lemonade or have their car washed.  Like Plaintiff's speech, this speech is obviously not obstructive where a speaker is not impeding someone's right of way and not causing the motorist to take evasive action.  See Human v. Colarusso, No. 13-cv-296-SM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4866, at *4, 12, 2015 DNH 012 (D.N.H. Jan. 15, 2015) (noting that plaintiff \"obstructed pedestrian traffic at that intersection\" when he \"forc[ed] people to walk around his display to access the crosswalk\"). Indeed, under Defendant's extreme \"but/for\" causation theory, the owner of a sign on a median or a billboard telling a motorist to turn left on a single-lane road to enter a business could create an obstruction on a roadway when the driver slows down or even stops to make the turn in response to the speech.  Under this example, the speaker-here, the sign or billboard owner-would have violated the law simply because of how the motorist responded to his or her protected speech.  As a matter of common sense, this is obviously incorrect because (i) the speaker is not in the road doing the obstructing and (ii) there is an intervening act that severs any semblance of causation-namely, the free will of the motorist deciding to slow down or stop.3\nThe crux of Defendant's argument seems to be that he is entitled to qualified immunity because the term \"obstruction\" has not been defined by case law.  While it is true that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not interpreted the term \"obstruction,\" the qualified immunity analysis \"does not require a case directly on point.\"  Glik, 655 F.3d at 81.  A regulation or statute is sufficient in determining the contours of a legal right.  Put another way, the command of a statute is itself \"clearly established law.\"  See Santana v. Calderon, 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless (1) the facts alleged show the defendants' conduct violated a constitutional right, and (2) the contours of this right are 'clearly established' under then-existing law so that a reasonable officer would have known that his conduct was unlawful.\"); see also Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194 n.12 (1984) (\"officials become liable for damages only to the extent that there is a clear violation of the statutory rights that give rise to the cause of action for damages\") (emphasis added); Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 733 (2002) (guards' conduct in twice handcuffing the plaintiff to a hitching post to sanction him for disorderly conduct violated clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known; decision based, in part, on regulation authority).  Of course, the most egregious violations of rights may not engender legal opinions or may not even happen at all.  This is why statutes and regulations can, by themselves, define the contours of legal rights and prevent qualified immunity when these clearly- established rights are violated.\nFinally, determining whether qualified immunity exists here is also premature.  For example, Defendant's Motion cannot be fully examined without further discovery into how the Manchester Police Department has historically interpreted the disorderly conduct law applied against Plaintiff. To the extent Officer Brandreth's interpretation is not one that he or the Department has historically applied, that would tend to support the fact that the Officer's application of this statute is novel and deviated from its plain terms.  The evidence in this case is likely to reveal-as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint and its exhibits-that this interpretation is entirely new and was only recently adopted in approximately 2015.  Discovery may also reveal that Officer Brandreth has never applied his interpretation to, for example, teenagers on the side of the road soliciting motorists to buy an item or have their car washed-facts which would further demonstrate how this interpretation as applied to panhandlers is a selective distortion of an otherwise clear statute.  Given this reality, Defendant's request for qualified immunity would be best raised in a Motion for Summary Judgment after the close of discovery.  See DeMayo v. Nugent, 517 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"If Nugent and Lugas wished to present evidence of additional facts that might refute or undermine DeMayo's pleadings, the place to do so was in their response to his motion.\").",

Although it is said to be \"against all Defendants\" it appears only to describe the development of a municipal policy to use RSA 644:2(II)(c), and otherwise complains about failure of training, etc. In fact in paragraph 110 it alleges, \"the City of Manchester failed to train its police officers about the First Amendment right of individuals to peacefully panhandle in public places adjacent to roadways and how to properly apply RSA 644:2(II)(c) thereby permitting Officer Brandreth to be in a position to selectively and in a discriminatory fashion violate Ms. Petrello's constitutional rights.\" As discussed above, Officer Brandreth was following department policy (See Exh.

Where a classification \"realistically reflects the fact that the [two groups] are not similarly situated in certain circumstances,\" id., and the legislation's differing treatment of the groups is sufficiently related to a government interest, it will survive an equal protection challenge. In re Sandra H., 150 N.H. 634, 638 (2004). In this case, the Plaintiff is the motivating force behind the vehicle stopping with a green light; the vehicle only stopped because the Plaintiff solicited it to do so. Additionally, the Plaintiff was a pedestrian; the other party was the driver of a two-ton automobile in motion; it can't be said that theses two parties were similarly situated. As to the qualified immunity defense as applied to Officer Brandreth, unless the Plaintiff can demonstrate that it was clearly established law that Officer Brandreth had to chase down and ticket the Cadillac before he could ticket Ms. Petrello, then qualified immunity should apply on this basis as well to the Equal protection claim.",

Where the officer has a reasonable concern about potential criminal activity based on his on the spot observations, and where immediate action is required to ensure that any criminal activity is stopped or prevented, the officer may stop the subject.

Further, the allegation is that Ms. Petrello was attempting to get vehicles to stop, that was her purpose on the sidewalk, and that a vehicle in fact stopped, even though it had the green light, causing another vehicle to stop behind it even though traffic had the right of way with the green light, and causing the second vehicle to miss the traffic cycle. The sole reason for the vehicle that obstructed traffic behind it to stop was Ms. Petrello's solicitation, and no other allegation is made as to any other reason why the vehicle would stop.  Accordingly under simple \"but for\" causation analysis, Ms. Petrello was causing an obstruction in traffic and therefore violated the disorderly conduct statute.  However, for immediate purposes here under a Fourth Amendment analysis, all that Officer Brandreth needed was a reasonable suspicion to stop Ms. Petrello because she was obstructing traffic, and that was satisfied.  Accordingly, there was no Fourth Amendment violation by Officer Brandreth.\nIn an analogous case, the Supreme Court of Washington found that application of a Washington ordinance that made it unlawful to intentionally obstruct vehicle traffic was constitutional and was not void for vagueness, and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause when a panhandler brought a challenge to it (for what was apparently obstruction of pedestrian as opposed to vehicular traffic).  A key factor in the decision was that the obstructing activity was intentional. Seattle v. Webster, 802 P.2d 1334 (1990).",

        "response_content": "Defendant's actions in detaining and citing Plaintiff-who was peacefully panhandling and not stepping in the roadway-violated clearly-established statutory law, and therefore violated Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights.\nThe Fourth Amendment prevents unreasonable seizures of persons.  Where an \"officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen ... a 'seizure' has occurred.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968); see also United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 553 (1980).  In effect, a person has been \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.  Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure . . . would be the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.\nMendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554 (emphasis added).  A seizure may violate the Fourth Amendment even if it does not constitute an arrest or its equivalent.  Such seizures do not violate the Fourth Amendment where the officer, based \"on a reasonable and articulable suspicion,\" makes the stop to \"investigate suspected past or present criminal activity.\"  United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996)); see also Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"When there is probable cause for an arrest, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is not offended.\").  Put another way, a seizure under Terry violates the Fourth Amendment where there is no \"reasonable and articulable suspicion\" that the person has or is engaging in criminal activity. Here, Defendant, as he must, concedes that Plaintiff was seized.  Plaintiff also claims that the summons, itself, lacked probable cause.\nUnder the disorderly conduct statute, \"[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct if: ... He or she: ... (c) Obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic on any public street or sidewalk or the entrance to any public building.\").  See RSA 644:2(II)(c) (emphasis added). Consistent with the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, video Plaintiff produced in discovery reveals that Defendant's detention of Plaintiff was based solely on (i) Plaintiff's speech to passing motorists asking them to make a donation and (ii) a motorist's reaction to her speech, which Defendant claimed was obstructing the roadway.  According to the video, Plaintiff was stopped \"[b]ased on your behavior ... by being out here with a sign panhandling for money, having a car stop, and then not allowing the second car who was not able to get through the intersection that it should have ....\"  See Exhibit 1 (emphasis added).2  Thus, the question here is whether it would be objectively reasonable for Defendant Officer Brandreth to suspect that a peaceful panhandler soliciting motorists from a public place is \"obstructing\" traffic simply when a car slows down or stops in response to the panhandler's specific speech asking for a donation.\nAs is clear by using both common sense and examining the disorderly conduct statute's plain terms, a peaceful panhandler soliciting donations from motorists in a public place is not obstructing traffic, regardless of how the motorist responds.  According to Black's Law Dictionary, to \"obstruct\" means \"[t]o block up; to interpose obstacles; to render impassable; to fill with barriers or impediments; as to obstruct a road or way.\"  See \"Obstruct,\" Black's Law Dictionary, available at http://thelawdictionary.org/obstruct/.  A peaceful panhandler in a public place engaging in speech directed at motorists is not \"blocking,\" \"interposing obstacles,\" \"rendering impassable\" or \"filling with barriers or impediments\" in a roadway.  To the extent anyone is obstructing a roadway, it would be the motorist who makes the independent, intervening decision to slow down or stop his car and make a donation-not the panhandler who is simply conveying a peaceful message adjacent to the roadway.  Under Defendant's theory, a teenager on a public place adjacent to a roadway would be criminally liable for disorderly conduct when a motorist slows down in response to the teenager's speech simply asking (whether it be verbally or through a sign) motorists to pull over or make a turn to buy lemonade or have their car washed.  Like Plaintiff's speech, this speech is obviously not obstructive where a speaker is not impeding someone's right of way and not causing the motorist to take evasive action.  See Human v. Colarusso, No. 13-cv-296-SM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4866, at *4, 12, 2015 DNH 012 (D.N.H. Jan. 15, 2015) (noting that plaintiff \"obstructed pedestrian traffic at that intersection\" when he \"forc[ed] people to walk around his display to access the crosswalk\"). Indeed, under Defendant's extreme \"but/for\" causation theory, the owner of a sign on a median or a billboard telling a motorist to turn left on a single-lane road to enter a business could create an obstruction on a roadway when the driver slows down or even stops to make the turn in response to the speech.  Under this example, the speaker-here, the sign or billboard owner-would have violated the law simply because of how the motorist responded to his or her protected speech.  As a matter of common sense, this is obviously incorrect because (i) the speaker is not in the road doing the obstructing and (ii) there is an intervening act that severs any semblance of causation-namely, the free will of the motorist deciding to slow down or stop.3\nThe crux of Defendant's argument seems to be that he is entitled to qualified immunity because the term \"obstruction\" has not been defined by case law.  While it is true that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not interpreted the term \"obstruction,\" the qualified immunity analysis \"does not require a case directly on point.\"  Glik, 655 F.3d at 81.  A regulation or statute is sufficient in determining the contours of a legal right.  Put another way, the command of a statute is itself \"clearly established law.\"  See Santana v. Calderon, 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless (1) the facts alleged show the defendants' conduct violated a constitutional right, and (2) the contours of this right are 'clearly established' under then-existing law so that a reasonable officer would have known that his conduct was unlawful.\"); see also Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194 n.12 (1984) (\"officials become liable for damages only to the extent that there is a clear violation of the statutory rights that give rise to the cause of action for damages\") (emphasis added); Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 733 (2002) (guards' conduct in twice handcuffing the plaintiff to a hitching post to sanction him for disorderly conduct violated clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known; decision based, in part, on regulation authority).  Of course, the most egregious violations of rights may not engender legal opinions or may not even happen at all.  This is why statutes and regulations can, by themselves, define the contours of legal rights and prevent qualified immunity when these clearly- established rights are violated.\nFinally, determining whether qualified immunity exists here is also premature.  For example, Defendant's Motion cannot be fully examined without further discovery into how the Manchester Police Department has historically interpreted the disorderly conduct law applied against Plaintiff. To the extent Officer Brandreth's interpretation is not one that he or the Department has historically applied, that would tend to support the fact that the Officer's application of this statute is novel and deviated from its plain terms.  The evidence in this case is likely to reveal-as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint and its exhibits-that this interpretation is entirely new and was only recently adopted in approximately 2015.  Discovery may also reveal that Officer Brandreth has never applied his interpretation to, for example, teenagers on the side of the road soliciting motorists to buy an item or have their car washed-facts which would further demonstrate how this interpretation as applied to panhandlers is a selective distortion of an otherwise clear statute.  Given this reality, Defendant's request for qualified immunity would be best raised in a Motion for Summary Judgment after the close of discovery.  See DeMayo v. Nugent, 517 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"If Nugent and Lugas wished to present evidence of additional facts that might refute or undermine DeMayo's pleadings, the place to do so was in their response to his motion.\").",

An increased potential for inconsistent judgments is grounds for finding a party necessary under Rule 19(a).  See Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.

Of course, it would be proper for this Court to order U.S. Bank to join Justrite in this suit if such is feasible.

For example, the Sofield Parties will defend against U.S. Bank's claims on the merits on grounds that U.S. Bank did not distribute the escrowed funds to them either \"inadvertently\" or improperly, but in fact properly distributed them because Justrite's purported \"Pending Claim Notice\" was patently deficient and ineffective on its face under the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 4  Accordingly, U.S. Bank was required to make the final distribution pursuant to \u00a75.3 of the Escrow Agreement.\nThe Sofield Parties will also defend U.S. Bank's claims on the merits on grounds that nothing in the Escrow Agreement obliged them to return any monies once such were distributed to them; that the Escrow Agreement terminated of its own terms once the final distribution was made; 5 that U.S. Bank has no obligation to seek return of the distributed funds and is proceeding as a mere volunteer in this lawsuit; 6 and that the Purchase Agreement specifically contemplates and provides that Justrite is to seek recourse for any such indemnification claim as it purports to have directly against the Sofield Companies since there are no longer any funds in escrow. 7\nThese same or similar arguments will be made in any litigation subsequently brought by Justrite (whether against the Sofield Parties and/or U.S. Bank) to dispute the right of the Sofield Parties to the final distribution of the escrowed funds and to assert its purported indemnification claim.  And if Justrite is not joined as a party in this action, Justrite will be entitled to re-litigate any determination made on these issues by this Court in this action.  The Sofield Parties will thus be exposed to multiple and potentially inconsistent judicial determinations on the same issues.\nIf the Sofield Parties prevail in this case, Justrite is still free to pursue them directly in another lawsuit on claims that the Sofield Parties must return the final escrowed amounts to U.S. Bank for escrow and that they are responsible to indemnify Justrite for the purported I-9 documentation issues.  If U.S. Bank prevails on its claims, it will subsequently have to bring an interpleader action, and the Sofield Parties will have to litigate their right to the escrowed funds again.  Either way, the Sofield Parties will be subject to multiple lawsuits regarding the same fundamental issues, imposing upon it the substantial risk of inconsistent judgments and unnecessary litigation.\nFurther, there is no suggestion that Justrite (and U.S. Bank, to the extent it is found to have any real interest in this dispute) would not have an adequate remedy by proceeding in the North Carolina state courts.  Justrite is apparently engaged in operations in North Carolina, as it purchased the Sofield Parties' business operations in the state, and can easily litigate in the state courts.  Most if not all of the witnesses and documents that would be pertinent to the dispute between Justrite and the Sofield Parties are located in North Carolina, and the state court is fully capable of rendering a fair decision among these North Carolina residents.  See Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Meade, 186 F.3d 435, 441-442 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"[W]e see no reason why the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia will not provide an adequate remedy for the parties in this case. In fact, it is likely the best place for the adjudication of this matter since all of the Plaintiffs work at the same location and will share many witnesses and exhibits in the event a trial is held.  The West Virginia state court is more than capable of rendering an adequate and fair judgment in this matter.\")\nIn sum, Justrite should be determined an \"indispensable' party under Rule 19(b) and, unless U.S. Bank can join Justrite as a party, this action should be dismissed.",

        "response_content": "Because Justrite is not a required party to the action under Rule 19(a), the Court need not reach the Rule 19(b) analysis.  But if the Court were to find Justrite to be a required party and in the event that Justrite could not be joined, then the Court would have to \"determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).  The factors to be considered in conducting that assessment include:\n(1)  the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;\n(2)  the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by: (A) protective provisions in the judgment; (B) shaping the relief; or (C) other measures;\n(3)  whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and\n(4)  whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder. Id.\nThe Sofield Parties claim that \"[r]esolution of U.S. Bank's claims will require the Court to determine the rights of U.S. Bank, Justrite, and the Sofield Parties under the Escrow Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.\"  (Defendants' MTD at 9.)  That is simply not the case: There's no reason for the Court to have to interpret the Purchase Agreement-U.S. Bank is not a party to that Agreement and has no interest in any dispute over it-or to determine Justrite's rights.2\nThe Sofield Parties also contend that Justrite is \"indispensable\" because the arguments that the Sofield Parties will assert in this case will be the \"same or similar\" to arguments that they might make in any subsequent litigation with Justrite. (Id.)  Specifically, the Sofield Parties claim that they intend to defend this case on the grounds that:\n\u2022 \"U.S. Bank was required to make the final distribution pursuant to \u00a75.3 of the Escrow Agreement\"\n\u2022 \"nothing in the Escrow Agreement obliged [the Sofield Parties] to return any monies once such were distributed to them\"\n\u2022 \"the Escrow Agreement terminated of its own terms once the final distribution was made\"\n\u2022 \"U.S. Bank has no obligation to seek return of the distributed funds...\"\n\u2022 \"the Purchase Agreement specifically contemplates and provides that Justrite is to seek recourse for any such indemnification claim as it purports to have directly against the Sofield Parties since there are no longer any funds in escrow.\"\n(Defendants' MTD at 10.)\nContrary to the Sofield Parties' claim, those arguments have nothing to do with whether Justrite could successfully pursue indemnification from the Sofield Parties for breaching the Purchase Agreement-the crux of the underlying dispute between Justrite and the Sofield Parties. Returning the money to U.S. Bank pending resolution of the underlying dispute is completely consistent with an ultimate finding for either party, including that the Sofield Parties are, in fact, entitled to the funds.\nNeither the Sofield Parties nor Justrite is prejudiced by U.S. Bank's holding the disputed funds to ensure that they are available to whichever party prevails in the underlying dispute.  The Court should deny the Sofield Parties' Rule 12(b)(7) motion to dismiss the Complaint because Justrite is neither \"necessary\" nor \"indispensable.\"",

Accordingly, U.S. Bank may not maintain a claim for unjust enrichment under North Carolina law.\nEven if the claim were not barred in light of the Escrow Agreement, U.S. Bank's claim for unjust enrichment would fail.  \"Not every enrichment of one by the voluntary act of another is unjust. 'Where a person has officiously conferred a benefit upon another, the other is enriched but is not considered to be unjustly enriched.

U.S. Bank \"officiously\" distributed the funds to the Sofield Parties wholly on its own instance.  Further, U.S. Bank did not distribute any \"benefit\" that it owned and for which it could be entitled to compensation; it acted merely as an escrow agent distributing money rightfully belonging to another.  U.S. Bank fails to state a valid claim for unjust enrichment.",

Britt, 359 S.E.2d 467, 469 (N.C. 1987).

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) The disbursement was a measurable benefit and was not made as a gift or to interfere in the Sofield Parties' affairs (notwithstanding the Sofield Parties' naked claim that U.S. Bank \"'officiously' distributed the funds to the Sofield Parties wholly on its own instance [sic]\").  (Defendants' MTD at 13.)\nThe Sofield Parties contend that U.S. Bank's unjust enrichment claim must be dismissed because there was an express contractual relationship between the parties (i.e., the Escrow Agreement).   But U.S. Bank may plead equitable claims in the alternative.  See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(3) (\"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain . . . a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief.\").  The Sofield Parties argue that upon U.S. Bank's distribution of the remaining escrowed funds to the Sofield Parties, the Escrow Agreement terminated.  (Defendants' MTD at 10.)  If the Sofield Parties are correct, then the contract wouldn't bar U.S. Bank's equitable remedy for the Sofield Parties' post-contractual conduct.\nUnder Section 6 of the Escrow Agreement, the Agreement \"shall terminate on the first to occur of (a) the disbursement of the entire amount of the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms hereof or (b) a mutual consent signed by Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative.\"  Although the Complaint alleges that the disbursement of the disputed funds was inadvertent (Compl. \u00b6 25), the Sofield Parties argue that the contract terminated upon the disbursement of the funds (Defendants' MTD at 10).  In that case, the Sofield Parties' actions (holding the funds) arose post-contract and are, therefore, not governed by the contract.\nThe general rule that an express contract precludes a claim for unjust enrichment does not apply where \"the implied agreement is based upon the conduct of the parties subsequent to, and not covered by, the terms of the express contract.\" Schuck Corp. v.

Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co., 386 F.3d 581, 593 (4th Cir. 2004).  An \"actual controversy\" may exist where a plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment in order to avoid the accrual of \"avoidable damages.\"  See id. (citing NUCOR Corp. v. Aceros Y Maquilas de Occidente, 28 F.3d 572, 577 (7th Cir. 1994)). U.S. Bank fails to make any allegations identifying the potential liability or damage that it seeks to avoid that would entitle it to a declaratory judgment.  Nor do its allegations show how such a judgment entered by this Court as between the existing parties - U.S. Bank and the Sofield Parties - could provide it with relief with respect to such potential liability or damage.\nThe complaint and the exhibits attached to the complaint make clear that the Sofield Parties have no grounds to sue U.S. Bank and have never threatened litigation against U.S.\nBank.  Thus, there is no potential liability or damages claimed by the Sofield Parties that U.S. Bank seeks to avoid or have clarified.\nAny liability that U.S. Bank might seek to avoid in this lawsuit would be a liability not to the Sofield Parties but to Justrite.  Yet U.S. Bank fails to allege any facts concerning any possible litigation by Justrite against it - much less establish that such litigation \"appears to be unavoidable.\"  Moreover, even if litigation was threatened by Justrite, any potential liability of U.S. Bank to Justrite is both speculative and remote. 10  Further, the action taken by U.S. Bank that could give rise to liability (the release of the escrowed funds) has already occurred and could not occur again, so as lead to the accrual of additional damages, as U.S. Bank no longer holds any escrowed funds. 11\nIn any event, and more to the point, any determination by this Court as to whether (i) U.S. Bank had any right or obligation to withhold escrowed funds, and (ii) the Sofield Parties have any obligation to return funds already distributed to them will not have any binding effect upon Justrite, as it is not a party to this lawsuit and could not be bound by the Court's determinations.  Thus, any declaratory judgment by this Court is likely to amount to a mere advisory opinion, having no binding effect on Justrite in any subsequent suit it brings against either U.S. Bank or the Sofield Parties, except insofar as the Court's decision suits Justrite's purposes and is later used by it against either of those parties.  In effect, U.S. Bank and Justrite would get to take two bites at the same apple against the Sofield Parties.  For the Sofield Parties, on the other hand, this action would bring neither certainty nor finality, but only the expense of duplicative litigation and the risk of inconsistent legal determinations.\nIn sum, there is no \"actual controversy\" between U.S. Bank and the Sofield Parties that threatens U.S. Bank with the accrual of avoidable damages.  Any damages or liability of U.S. Bank would be as the result of a controversy between it and Justrite, and is both wholly speculative and not properly determined in this action, where Justrite has not been joined as a party.  Under these circumstances, a declaratory judgment is not proper in any event.\nWHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant their Motion to Dismiss and DISMISS Plaintiff's Complaint.",

The Complaint alleges that the Sofield Parties are in possession of the disputed funds and that U.S. Bank is entitled to immediate possession of them pending resolution of Justrite's indemnification claims.  This is not an academic undertaking, and U.S. Bank has standing to seek a declaratory judgment by virtue of its role as escrow agent.\nSecond, the Court has diversity jurisdiction over this action, because the Sofield Parties are citizens of North Carolina, U.S. Bank is a citizen of Minnesota and Ohio, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\nThird, it would be entirely proper for the Court to exercise its discretion to enter a declaratory judgment. While doing so will not resolve all disputes as between the Sofield Parties and Justrite, it will resolve this dispute between U.S. Bank and the Sofield Parties over the inadvertently released funds.\nThe Court should exercise its discretion to deny the Sofield Parties' motion to dismiss U.S. Bank's claim for declaratory judgment.",

Here, the letter sent by Plaintiff, merely states that he \"make(s) this request, based on our dispute of the amounts due and owing stated on/by your Complaint.\"  The letter goes on to list 13 categories of documents it would like to review.  This type of request is not sufficient to constitute a QWR as it merely disputes the debt and does not include a statement of the reason the borrower believes the account is in error, nor does it contain sufficient detail to allow BANA to review the account for potential errors in servicing. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1)(B); Catalan, 629 F.3d at 686.  Therefore, Plaintiff's claim that BANA violated RESPA fails and should be dismissed.\nEven if this Court determines Plaintiff's letter constitutes a proper QWR, Plaintiff's claim still fails because BANA timely responded to Plaintiff's request, within 20 days of receipt of Plaintiff's letter, and this is within the appropriate time frame under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A). Within 20 days of receiving a QWR, a servicer must send a written acknowledgement of the request. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A). Within 60 days after receiving a qualified written request, the servicer must, among other options, investigate the borrower's account and either provide the requested information or provide an explanation as to why the requested information is unavailable. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a72605(e)(2)(C).  Here, Plaintiff admits that the October 4, 2011, letter sent by Blank Rome, LLP, on BANA's behalf is responsive to the alleged QWR request, but seems to suggest that the response was not timely sent.  [See \u00b649 of Plaintiff's Complaint]. Plaintiff's allegations are misleading; he alleges that the QWR was sent to BANA on June 21, 2011, however Plaintiff's allegation is betrayed by Plaintiff's own exhibit.  [See Exhibit I to Plaintiff's Complaint].  The last page of Plaintiff's Exhibit I shows that Plaintiff did not sign the letter until July 5, 2011, not June 21, 2011, as stated in the Complaint.

Thus the response, to the extent this was a valid QWR request in the first place, which it was not, was timely returned.\nPursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2605(a)(1)(A) and (2), the calculation of time excludes \"legal public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays.\"  BANA's acknowledgement and response were both sent within the time allowed: the acknowledgement letter was sent nine days after receiving the QWR and the response letter was sent 60 days after receiving the QWR (excluding Labor Day, and all Saturdays and Sundays).

Defendant also omitted the first five words of the sentence that make it clear that the Court was not expressing its own opinion: \"GMAC Mortgage argues that the . . . \"  Id.\nThe Catalan Court's words actually reflect the opposite sentiment: \"Any reasonably stated written request for account information can be a qualified written request.\"  Id. at 867.\nRESPA does not require any magic language before a servicer must construe a written communication from a borrower as a qualified written request and respond accordingly. The language of the provision is broad and clear. To be a qualified written request, a written correspondence must reasonably identify the borrower and account and must \"include a statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower, to the extent applicable, that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1)(B) (emphasis added). * * * To the extent that a borrower is able to provide reasons for a belief that the account is in error, the borrower should provide them, but any request for information made with sufficient detail is enough under RESPA to be a qualified written request and thus to trigger the servicer's obligations to respond. Id.\nIndeed, according to statute, the only other requirements for a communication to constitute a QWR is that it is \"written correspondence, other than notice on a payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the servicer, that includes, other otherwise enables the servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower[.]\"  12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1)(B).  \"By GMAC Mortgage's argument [and that of Defendant here], a lender would have no obligation to respond to a borrower who expressed her belief that her account was in error but was unable to provide specific reasons for that belief, an untenable result under the language of the statute.\" Catalan, 629 F.3d at 686.\nMr. Caines' correspondence to Defendant fulfilled all of the statutory requirements necessary to constitute a QWR and thus to trigger the protections of RESPA.  Therefore, Count I of his Complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n2. Defendant Violated RESPA's Timeliness Requirements Anticipating that the Court might consider Mr. Caines' correspondence a proper QWR (which it clearly should), Defendant argued in the alternative that Mr. Caines' RESPA claim \"still fails because [Defendant] timely responded to Plaintiff's request . . . . \"  (Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 6).  Not so.  Defendant is mistaken in its construction of the law.\nEven if Defendant received Mr. Caines' QWR on July 11th, 2011 (as asserted by the Defendant) and not July 5, 2011 (as asserted under the complaint), he was not provided with a response until more than 60 days later.  There are two points to be made here: (1) the calculation should include July 11, and thus Mr. Caines should have had a response to his QWR no later than October 3, 2011; and (2) Defendant's response was only dated (and possibly sent) on October 4 - Mr. Caines was not provided with the information he requested until he received the response several days later.",

        "moving_content": "Count II fails to meet the federal pleading standards under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and Rule 9(b), and therefore should be dismissed.  The Indiana Home Loan Practices Act prohibits persons from engaging in deceptive acts in connection with mortgage transactions.  I.C. \u00a7 24-9-3-7(c)(3). To establish a \"deceptive act\" Plaintiff must show that as part of a mortgage transaction BANA knowingly or intentionally: (1) made a material misrepresentation; or (2) concealed material information regarding the terms or conditions of the transaction.  I.C. \u00a7 24-9-2-7; Collins v. America's Servicing Company, 652 F.3d 711, 715 (7th Cir. 2011).  \"Knowingly\" means having actual knowledge at the time of the transaction.  I.C. \u00a7 24-9-2-7.\nMerely reciting the elements of a cause of action without factual support, is not sufficient to state a claim.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8.  To plead a cause of action demands more than an unadorned, \"the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation\" or a \"sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\" Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56).  It \"requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\" Id. at 1954 (Rule 8 does not empower a defendant to plead the bare elements of a cause of action, affix the label \"general allegation\" and expect the complaint to survive a motion to dismiss), (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts to support his claim that BANA knowingly or intentionally made a material representation or concealed material information regarding the terms or conditions of his transaction, and instead merely concludes that BANA has done so.\nAdditionally, Plaintiff's claim under the IHLPA amounts to nothing more than allegations of misrepresentation or fraud; therefore, Plaintiff's claim must be pleaded with specificity. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); Sears v. Likens, 912 F.2d 889, 893 (7th Cir. 1990) (ruling that officers failed to allege fraud with sufficient particularity where they neglected to \"state in any detail what misrepresentations were made by the defendant, to whom these misrepresentations were made, when these misrepresentations were made, or how these misrepresentations furthered the alleged fraudulent scheme.\"); see also DiLeo v. Ernst & Young, 901 F.2d 624 (7th Cir.1990). In other words, Rule 9(b) requires the plaintiff to include \"the 'who, what, when, and where' of the alleged fraud.\" Uni Quality, Inc. v. Infotronx, Inc., 974 F.2d 918, 923 (7th Cir.1992).  Here, Plaintiff fails to identify who made the alleged material misrepresentations, when, where, and about what.  Plaintiff merely states that \"[t]hroughout [BANA]'s interactions with [Plaintiff], [BANA] engaged in one or more deceptive acts...with respect to [Plaintiff]'s home loan.\"  [See \u00b6 60 of Plaintiff's Complaint].  Such a general allegation is utterly insufficient to inform the Court or BANA of what alleged acts constitute a knowing or intentional material misrepresentation under the Indiana Home Loan Practices Act. I.C. \u00a7 24-9-2-7.\nMoreover, to the extent Plaintiff claims BANA engaged in a deceptive act in relation to the May 28, 2009, conditional loan modification offer, Plaintiff cannot establish that BANA knowingly or intentionally made a material misrepresentation or concealed information, because the plain language of the conditional loan modification offer sets forth all requirements to perform and the consequences of not performing. Collins supra, 652 F3d. at 715.  The conditional loan modification offer required that the agreement be returned, signed and notarized, as well as the bankruptcy stay be lifted prior to June 11, 2009, and payments be made on the first of each month.  [See Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  The conditional loan modification offer also expressly states that \"[i]n the event you do not or cannot fulfill ALL of the terms and conditions of this letter no later than June 11, 2009, we will continue our collections actions without giving you additional notices or response periods.\"  [See Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].\nPlaintiff's own rendition of the facts indicates he violated nearly every condition-he does not allege that he signed and returned the loan modification offer to BANA, and he states that he did not make the first payment by the deadline of July 1, 2009, but rather made his first payment nine months later on April 14, 2010.  [See \u00b6\u00b622 and 25 of Plaintiff's Complaint]. Plaintiff alleges however, that BANA received a payment on July 6, 2009, which even if this payment was made by Plaintiff, this late payment violated the terms.  Plaintiff also indicates there was no Bankruptcy related activity until October 2009, when the lifting of the stay needed to happen before June 11, 2009.  [See \u00b6\u00b6 20-25 of Plaintiff's Complaint and Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].\nAny allegation that BANA's collection actions constitute deceptive acts fails, as the conditional loan modification agreement specifically allows BANA to continue with collection actions, including foreclosure, in the event Plaintiff \"do[es] not or cannot fulfill ALL of the terms and conditions of the [conditional loan modification offer]\". Collins, 652 F3d. at 715; See Baker v. America's Mortgage Servicing, Inc., 58 F.3d 321, 328 (7th Cir.1995) (assessment of late fees under a mortgage agreement does not violate a state's consumer fraud statute if they are assessed in accordance with the express terms of the contract).

        "moving_content": "i. Breach of Contract\nCount III of Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim for breach of contract.  As a preliminary matter, it is well-established that a plaintiff cannot succeed on a breach of contract claim unless he demonstrates his own performance of the contract's requirements. See Hukic v. Aurora Loan Services, 588 F.3d 420, 433 (7th Cir.2009).  Here, Plaintiff failed to perform under the contract by his own admission, which is fatal to his claim.  The loan modification agreement states in \u00b64 \"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Note and Security Instrument will remain unchanged, and the Borrower and Lender will be bound by, and comply with, all terms and provisions thereof, as amended by this Agreement.\"  [See Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  Like the loan modification agreement, \u00b63(A) of the original Note provides that payments are due on the first of each month.  Also like the loan modification agreement, no grace period is provided; in fact \u00b67(B) of the Note acknowledges that Plaintiff is in default if the payment is not made on the first of the month.  [See Exhibit B of Plaintiff's Complaint].\nHere, the first payment was due on July 1, 2009, and by Plaintiff's own admission, the first payment was not made on time.  [See \u00b6\u00b622 and 25 of Plaintiff's Complaint].  At best, Plaintiff pleads BANA's records show a payment was received on July 6, 2009.2  [See \u00b625 of Plaintiff's Complaint].  Even if Plaintiff alleged he made the first payment on July 6, 2009, which he does not, he is in default.  [See \u00b6\u00b6 3(A) and 7(D) of Exhibit B, and Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  Additionally, the conditional loan modification offer specifically required that the bankruptcy stay be lifted on or before June 11, 2009, for the agreement to take effect.  This did not occur until December 2009.  [See \u00b622 of Plaintiff's Complaint].  The plain language of the conditional loan modification offer is clear, and Plaintiff failed to demonstrate he performed according to the terms of the conditional loan modification offer, thus Plaintiff's claim for breach of contract fails and should be dismissed. Hukic, 588 F.3d at 433.\nii. Promissory Estoppel\nCounts III and V of Plaintiff's Complaint both assert a claim for promissory estoppel, however Plaintiff fails to state a claim.  Promissory estoppel requires:  (1) a promise by the promissor; (2) made with the expectation that the promisee will rely thereon; (3) which induces reasonable reliance by the promise; (4) of a definite and substantial nature; and (5) injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. Brown v. Branch, 758 N.E.2d 48, 52 (Ind. 2001).  \"[T]he party asserting the doctrine carries a heavy burden establishing its applicability.\" Id. \"In order to establish an estoppel to remove the case from the operation of the Statute of Frauds, the party must show [ ] that the other party's refusal to carry out the terms of the agreement has resulted not merely in a denial of the rights which the agreement was intended to confer, but the infliction of an unjust and unconscionable injury and loss.\" Id. at 52.  Here, the only representations alleged to have been made by BANA are expressly set forth in the original Mortgage and the written conditional loan modification offer.3  [See Exhibits A and C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  As indicated above, Plaintiff failed to comply with the express terms, thus Plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim also fails.  Additionally, Plaintiff does not establish, among other things, that justice would require the conditional loan modification offer to be enforced, or that Plaintiff suffered independent or substantial injury.\nAssuming Plaintiff complied with all other conditions of the conditional loan modification agreement (i.e., returning the agreement, signed and notarized, and obtaining a relief from stay of the bankruptcy court4), Plaintiff still did not comply with the loan modification agreement because he did not make his payments on time.  [See \u00b6\u00b623 and 25 of Plaintiff's Complaint and Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  Any claim that continued acceptance of the partial payments gives rise to a claim for promissory estoppel also fails.  The original Mortgage and Note, which were incorporated into the loan modification agreement, allows BANA to accept late or partial payment without waiving any default or right to pursue remedies against Plaintiff.  [See \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 12 of Exhibit A and \u00b6 7(D) of Exhibit B to Plaintiff's Complaint; and Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  Plaintiff's continued late and insufficient payments do not cure his default under the original Note and Mortgage, thus BANA had the right to move forward with a collection action, and Plaintiff's Complaint should be dismissed. See Collins, supra, 652 F.3d at 715. [See \u00b61 and 12 of Exhibit A and \u00b6 7(D) of Exhibit B to Plaintiff's Complaint].\nFinally, even if the Court determines Plaintiff has properly pleaded the other elements of promissory estoppel, Plaintiff fails to plead that reliance on BANA's alleged representations were to his detriment, thus Plaintiff's Complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Plaintiff has not, and cannot, allege that making the payments harmed him because Plaintiff was already obligated to make payments on this loan under the original Note and Mortgage.  [See Exhibits A and C to Plaintiff's Complaint].  The Indiana Supreme Court has held that \"[i]f what the party gave up in reliance on an oral promise was no greater than what the party would have given up in any event, then the consideration is deemed insufficient to remove the oral promise from the operation of the Statute of Frauds.\" Brown v. Branch, 758 N.E.2d 48, 52 (Ind. 2001).",
        "response_heading": "1. Breach of Contract",
        "response_content": "In its Motion to Dismiss, Defendant claims that Plaintiff, by his own admission, breached the conditional loan modification agreement and hence his Breach of Contract claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b).  (Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 9).  Mr. Caines has adequately stated a claim for breach of contract.  As explained in the preceding sections, Defendant filed a motion with the court indicating that a contract (the modification agreement) had successfully been negotiated.  (Pl. Complaint Exhibit D.)  Hence, the Defendants should be judicially estopped from claiming that there was no modification agreement between the parties.\nFurthermore, Defendants actions and claims are also in direct contradiction with the court order dated December 7th, 2009. (Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6 22.)  The court order approved the Motion for Loan Modification filed jointly by Mr. Caines and the Defendant. Id. Hence a breach of the conditional modification agreement prior to this order should not discharge Defendants of their contractual duties after said order was issued.\nEven if Defendant is not judicially estopped from denying the existence of a loan modification (which it is) or bound by the court order referenced above, Defendants claim that Mr. Caines breached the conditional modification agreement is also inaccurate. The Conditional Agreement requires that: (1) Mr. Caines makes the first payment on July 1st, 2009; (2) Mr. Caines provides income information (by an unspecified date) and a few other specified documents by June 11th, 2009; (3) Lender obtaining Title-insurance; and (4) Bank of America receiving relief from stay from any ongoing bankruptcy proceeding.  (Pl. Compl., Exhibit C). Mr. Caines contends in his Complaint that he had met all conditions precedent for this Conditional Modification Agreement. Id. at \u00b6 69. Defendants claim that Mr. Caines did not comply with requirement (1) and \"failed to perform under the contract by his own admission . . . .\" (Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 9) by making late payments. Mr. Caines did no such thing.  The dates provided in his Complaint represented the dates that Defendant posted Mr. Caines payments, and not the dates on which they were sent or received.\nContrary to Defendants claims, Requirement (3) of the agreement does not state that Mr. Caines would be responsible for filing the motion for relief from stay, but that the bank should be able to obtain such relief.  From a practical standpoint, this is simply not the sort of motion filed by a debtor, since it is entirely for the benefit of the creditor.  Understandably, Mr. Caines did not interpret this provision of the agreement to mean that he would need to file such a motion, but rather that he would not oppose it. Similarly, requirement (4) was also contingent on Defendant obtaining title insurance. Defendant never contacted Mr. Caines regarding any liens on his property or for his assistance in acquiring said insurance. Hence, in light of the joint Motion for Loan modification and any lack of correspondence suggesting otherwise, Mr. Caines was right in assuming that requirement (4) was fulfilled.\nBased on the aforementioned arguments, Plaintiff asserts that his complaint for Breach of Contract should not be dismissed. Defendant's contention that no loan modification agreement exists between the parties is contrary to principles of Judicial Estoppel and in direct contradiction with a court order issued by a Bankruptcy court judge upon a joint motion by the Parties. Furthermore, even if said court order or principles of Judicial Estoppel were ignored, Plaintiffs complied with the terms of the Conditional Modification Agreement and there is no reason why Defendants should not hold their end of the bargain.",

A confidential relationship exists whenever confidence is reposed by one party in another with resulting superiority and influence exercised by the other.

He was one man up against an enormous corporation.  His was undoubtedly a position of \"inequality, dependence, weakness, or lack of knowledge.\"  Defendant abused Mr. Caines' trust when it reneged on the agreement that it filed with the Court.

Ms. Ortiz and Obsession are not grounding their due process claim on the fact that the City's ZBA made an improper decision when it denied their request for a variance permitting them to remain open until 2:00 a.m. on Monday through Thursday. Rather, Plaintiffs' due process claim is grounded in the fact that the Ordinances created a wholly invalid scheme whereby the City shut down a lawful business during state-sanctioned hours of operation.  The City was fully aware that such a scheme was beyond its powers.  See People v. De Jesus, 54 N.Y.2d 465 (1981) (striking down City of Rochester's earlier attempt to regulate bar hours); Lansdown Entertainment Corp. v.

The Plaintiffs' term the City's zoning code a scheme and claim it was so arbitrary and outrageous that it prevented the Plaintiff from conducting business.  The facts show that what the City did was require a use variance for operation of ANY business in a mixed use, residentially zoned district, for hours after 11 P.M., the hours people normally sleep.    The use variance requirement is not preempted by state law, only the restriction of hours on a business which serves alcohol and which is governed by the New York State ABC laws.\nThe New York State Courts have found that the hourly restriction on an alcohol related business is in contradiction of the New York State Alcohol and Beverage Control Law and preempted by New York State law.   The objective of the City of Rochester through Code Section 120-134 was to prevent ANY business from having hours above certain times in order to protect neighboring residents from unwarranted noise during hours that people typically sleep.    In order to show a constitutional violation which would rise to a \u00a71983 level offense the Plaintiffs would have to show that the City's ordinance was \"without reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate government objective.\"  Plaintiffs premise their motion on the allegation that they possessed a property right to operate their business until 2:00 A.M. and that the City's zoning ordinance was so arbitrary and outrageous that it violated the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. This cannot be shown in this matter.  The Plaintiffs allege the aforementioned actions have caused Plaintiff to \"sustain... loss of business and reduced revenues and damage to its reputation and business goodwill.

There is no material dispute as to the facts supporting summary adjudication on the issue of the City's liability for Obsessions' lost profits, lost business opportunity and lost good will during the hours that the City improperly prevented Plaintiffs from operating their lawful business despite their state-issued liquor license.\nThe City lost the De Jesus case three decades ago, and should have been fully aware of its utter lack of authority to limit bar hours.  The best that can be said is that the City took a calculated risk when it enacted the Ordinances.  This risky behavior resulted in a predictable and quantifiable loss.  After calling the tune, the City should not now be heard to complain that it must pay the piper.  Nor are the Plaintiffs required to demonstrate their losses with \"mathematical precision\":\nDamages resulting from the loss of future profits are often an approximation.

Here, the nullification of the copyright registrations is based upon the Plaintiff s alleged creation of wrap watches in 2009 and 2013, respectively. Within the watch industry it was common knowledge that wrap watches have been sold and marketed in commerce for many years before Sara Designs entered the market. It is well settled that rights to a mark derive not from a registration or adoption of a mark, but from its use. United Drug Co. V.

Mattress Madness Inc., 841 F.Supp. 1339, 1347 (EDNY 1994)(\"the first user who continuously uses an inherently distinctive mark in the relevant market, is the senior user and has priority over any second comers.\"). A satisfactory showing of priority gives the registrant a significant advantage in proving that it had an exclusive right to the sale and marketing of wrap watches. Johanna Farms, Inc. v. Citrus Bowl. Inc., 468 F.Supp. 866, 875 (EDNY 1978) (\"where claimants dispute the right to use a particular trademark, the general rule is that priority of appropriation and use determines which litigant will prevail in its use.\")\nThere is overwhelming evidence that Classic Time imported and sold watches in commerce years before the Plaintiffs first use of these marks in 2009 and 2013, as they appear in Exhibit B annexed to the Complaint.\nMarc Smouha, the Managing Director of Classic Time, has attested to the fact that Classic Time was selling wrap watches as early as the year 2005, which has been documented by exhibits annexed to this Motion which consist of documents from Classic's database. Consistent with these statements are the business records of Classic, also attached to the Affidavit of Marc Smouha, which reflect that sales of wrap watches took place for years prior to Plaintiffs first publication in 2009. (See Exhibit 4) On the basis of these documents fortified by the Smouha and Dweck Affidavits, Classic Time has come forward with solid evidence to establish sales of the wrap watches, the same design as those, the subject of this action, long before the 2009 and 2013 first used dates as pleaded by the Plaintiff. This evidence is compelling that prior to 2009, Classic Time and other companies, were selling in commerce, wrap watches which demonstrate that it, and other companies in the watch business, are the senior users of those wrap watches.\nIn addition, since the wrap part of a watch is basically functional, since this watch is either worn on a wrist or wrapped around an object, the wrap as a functional part of the jewelry or watch does not have any entitlement to protection since copyright protection attends to an expression of an idea, not to the idea itself. Mazer v. Stein, 349 US 201, 217 74S.Ct. 460, 470, 986 Ed. 630(1954).\nOn this basis, the copyrights of the Plaintiff are not protectable, with the result that Classic Time and NY & Co. are not excluded from the sale of the wrap watches. On the basis of the outstanding precedents, the first cause of action for copyright infringement should be dismissed.\nOn the basis of the wrap watches having been in existence years before the Plaintiffs first use in 2009, there can be no claim of originality by the Plaintiff. This is a major element for copyright protection. LM. NIMMER, THE Law OF COPYRIGHT \u00a710 at 32 (1975).\nOn an overall basis, this lawsuit is nothing more than an attempt by the Plaintiff to \"extort\" money from the Defendants based upon an illegal representation that is not original and not entitled to protection. To honor the Plaintiffs very questionable posture in this case, which has been very seriously contradicted by documentary evidence would simply put a weapon for harassment at the disposal of a greedy and mischievous copycat intent on appropriating and monopolizing functional and commonplace aesthetic design elements that individually and collectively lack originality and have long been in the public domain.",

The Difference in Price and Materials Used Between Plaintiff's and Defendants' Products Doesn't Preclude Confusion in the Marketplace.\nDefendants argument that there \"popularly priced\" watches can't be confused with that of Plaintiff's is not persuasive.  First off, likelihood of confusion is a complicated question of fact that court's will only sometimes make to determine whether \"products or marks are so dissimilar that no question of fact is presented\" on summary judgment and other times leave for the jury to\n\u200b \u200b determine (\u200bSee Harvey Cartoons v.

Savvy consumers looking for watches on the internet, only having or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation 842*842 of fact, which - (A) is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin ... of his or her goods ... shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a).\nNotwithstanding the above, Plaintiff contends that describing the watches as \"confusingly similar\" is a gross understatement.  The allegedly infringing watches retailed by New York & Co. are a clear and deliberate attempt to copy or \"knock off\" Sara Designs creative work.  Because of the market power and reach of New York & Co. they can effectively shut Sara Designs out of sales by offering the (due to the materials used) knock off product at prices that Sara Designs cannot compete with.",

See Jeffrey Milstein, Inc. v Greger, Lawlor, Roth, Inc., 58 F3d 27, 31 (2d Cir 1995). Plaintiff's Count does not and cannot allege or establish-in a market saturated with pre-existing and contemporary wrap-style watch designs-any element of the claimed infringed products to be inherently distinctive or having acquired distinctiveness. (Compl. 47-53.) In addition to the exhibits illustrating a vibrant and competitive market in wrap watch designs, the source-identifying element of this claim in this Complaint is further belied by Plaintiffs hallow and plainly overreaching allegation: \"in other words the Wrap Style Watches have acquired a source-identifying meaning associated with Plaintiff.\" (Compl. \"I 50.) The notion that \"Wrap Style Watches\"-as a design concept subcategory in the market for watches or jewelry-identify Plaintiff as their source is inherently incredible and plainly fanciful.

For this reason alone, Count II must be dismissed.

Based on the foregoing, Count 11 of the Complaint must be dismissed as a matter of law.\nFurthermore, Exhibit A, annexed to the Complaint, is a trademark registration for the mark, \"Sara Designs.\" It appears that the Plaintiff has mistakenly asserted in this cause of action that it has trademarked the words, \"Wrap Style\" Watches, and that such a phrase constitutes trade dress with secondary meaning in the marketplace. This is incorporated within Paragraphs 49 and 50 of the Complaint. In contrast, the trademark referred to by the Plaintiff, which it claims constitutes its trade dress, consists of the words, \"Sara Designs\" (with no claim that it has the exclusive right to use the word, \"Designs\", apart from the mark, \"Sara Designs\"). Nowhere on the registration statement in Exhibit A from the United States Patent and Trademark Office is there any reference to the phrase, \"Wrap Style Watches.\" Thus, the registered trademark is \"Sara Designs.\" Nowhere on the watches sold by the Defendants is there any reference to \"Sara Designs.\" On the contrary, the face of all of Defendants' watches bear the name, \"NY & Co.\", which also appears stamped on the back of each watch. The Plaintiff has not demonstrated, even in its Complaint, that it is entitled to any protection under its trademark registration for words, other than \"Sara Designs.\"\nIn addition, the phrase \"wrap watches\" is at best generic, which is factually descriptive. A generic mark is never entitled to protection. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976). The phrase \"wrap watches\" is descriptive and, as such, conveys something about the qualities, ingredients or characteristics of the watch. The word \"wrap\" describes the nature and characteristics of the watch as describing an object which is attached to the watch and wraps around the arm of the user or wraps around an object. The predominant feature of a descriptive phrase such as a \"wrap watch\" gives a consumer an immediate idea of the characteristics of the product.\nIn line with the above statement, Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1969) defines the word:\n\"wrap\", \"to enclose wholly or partially by coiling, looping, grasping or embracing; to serve as a surrounding cover, loop, envelope, wrapping, coil or band; to coil, fold, draw or twine so as to develop or encompass.\"\nThe dictionary definition clearly reflects that the word, \"wrap\" is descriptive.\nThe fact that wrap watches are functional and descriptive cannot be disputed. The \"wrap\" connotes that the band is to be coiled, or embraces that object to which the band and watch are to be attached. Thus, a wrap watch is a style of design. Styles are not entitled to protection. Peter Pan Fabrics Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F2d 487, 489 (2 Cir 1960). Nor are commonly used elements of jewelry designs entitled to copyright protection. DBC of New York, Inc. v. Merit Diamond Corp., 763 F. Supp 414 (SDNY 1991).\nWhile it is recognized that the phrase, \"Sara Designs\", might be entitled to protection for its trademarked name, in such a case the mark identifies the Plaintiff as the particular source of a product. On the other hand, the phrase, \"wrap or wrap style watches\", does not, and could not possibly, identify the Plaintiff as the source of all wrap watches. In this respect, the focus of the inquiry is whether or not the trade dress is of such a design that a buyer will immediately rely upon it to differentiate the product from those of competing manufacturers. Tone Bros., Inc. v. Cysco,28 F.3d 1192,1206 (Fed.Cir. 1994), cert, den., 514 U.S. 1015, 115 S.Ct. 1356, 131 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). While the trademark, \"Sara Designs\", may be valid as a trademark, it does not constitute trade dress. The decisive question is whether the phrase, \"wrap watches\" is \"likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.\" Duraco Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enterprises, Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1449 (3rd Cir. 1994).\nBy far more than just another distinction of the Plaintiffs products from those of the Defendants is the huge disparity in the prices of the Plaintiffs and Defendant's products. The Plaintiffs watches sell for hundreds of dollars each as is reflected in the advertising tear sheets of their products at Shopbop, Bloomingdale's Polyvore (Exhibit E). The watches distributed and sold by the Defendants at retail are offered at a fraction of the Plaintiff s watches, mostly under $20.00. The significant price of the Plaintiffs items lessens the likelihood of consumer confusion as to origin. Life Industries Corp. v. Star Brite Distributing Corp., 31 F 3d, 43 (2d Cir 1994).\nAnother major consideration for non-protection to the Plaintiff is that Plaintiff has its \"Sara Designs\" or \"SD\" on the face and on the back of each watch. This is distinguished considerably by the Defendants' \"NY & Co\" on the face and back of each watch (Exhibits C, D and E). The presence of the mark of the designer for each piece of jewelry lessens, if not eliminates, the possibility of confusion as to its origin; Bose Corp. v. Linear Design Labs Inc., 467 F2d 304, 309 (2 CR 1973).\nFinally, since the Defendants have not used the phrase, \"Sara Designs\", in any shape, form or manner, the second cause of action for trade dress infringement must be dismissed.",

The Sara Designs watches are distinguishable in the marketplace and have played a role in reviving an entire fashion subset.  Sara Designs is synonymous with this fashion subset.\nTo support this, there have been numerous features of Sara Designs particular \"wrap watches\" in popular magazines, websites, and in retail outlets such as Bloomingdale's and Shopbop which further help to serve as a validation on the Sara Design's brand penetration.\n\u200b \u200b of another.\" (\u200binternal citations and quotation marks \u200bomitted).\n\u200b \u200b citations o\u200b mitted)..

The possible use of deception and obtaining the pricing, manufacturing, and profit margin information constitute an extra element which avails Sara Designs to the Unfair Competition laws of the State of New York under this court's pendant jurisdiction.",

Bonito Boats involved a Florida statute prohibiting the use of direct molding to duplicate boat hulls. The Florida statutory rights were similar in scope and operation to the rights accorded a federal patentee. The Supreme Court held that the Florida statute conflicted with federal patent policy. In that vein, the Second Circuit warned:\n[A]lthough trade dress law may supplement copyright and patent law by protecting unpatentable product configurations and novel marketing techniques . . . overextension of trade dress protection can undermine restrictions in copyright and patent law that are designed to avoid monopolization of products and ideas. Consequently, courts should proceed with caution in assessing claims to unregistered trade dress protection so as not to undermine the objectives of these other laws.3\nTherefore, Count III of the Complaint must be dismissed as a matter of law as well as for Count II which fails as a matter of law.\nFurthermore, \"[t]he elements of trademark infringement under New York common law mirror the Lanham Act.\" Gucci Am., Inc. v.

As discussed above, where a plaintiff seeks to protect copyrightable subject matter based on a state law rights that are equivalent to those protected by the Copyright Act, the state law claim is preempted.

The subject matter of Plaintiffs claim for unjust enrichment-a design of a wrap-style watch-is clearly within scope of the Copyright Act. In addition, as is the case with state statutory deceptive practices claims, the Second Circuit has repeatedly held that a claim for unjust enrichment does not include any \"extra elements\" that would separate it from a copyright claim, and is thus preempted by Section 301 of the Copyright Act, See, e.g., Briarpatch Ltd. v.

Bildstein v. MasterCardInt'l, Inc., 329 F.Supp.2d 410, 413 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (granting 12(b)(6) motion where plaintiff failed to plead an actual injury, rather than mere deception).\nAs an initial matter, the mere allegation of deception is insufficient to plead actual injury under Section 349. See Small v. Lorillard Tobacco Co., 94 N.Y.2d 43, 56 (1999). In Small, the plaintiffs alleged that cigarette manufacturers had deceptively hid the fact from consumers that cigarettes were addictive and had they known they would not have purchased them, positing that customers had been injured by buying a product they would not have purchased absent the deceptive commercial practices. Id. The court rejected the plaintiffs' theory of \"deception as both act and injury,\" finding that plaintiffs' theory contained no \"manifestation of either pecuniary or 'actual' harm[.]\" Id.', accordBildstein, 329 F.Supp.2d at 415-16 (rejecting claim for failure to allege actual injury, rather than mere deception, where plaintiffs claimed they \"unknowingly\" paid foreign credit card charges).\nHere, the Plaintiff has failed to allege that consumers have suffered any injury, other than allegedly being deceived. Plaintiffs failure (and inability) to allege an actual injury to consumers is fatal to its claim.\nFurthermore, Plaintiff does not have standing to bring a claim under Section 349 because the alleged \"injury\" suffered by Plaintiff (infringement of their intellectual property) is not the same as the alleged injury suffered by consumers (deception). See City of New York v. Smokes- Spirts.Com, Inc., 12 N.Y.3d 616, 622 (2009) (City had no standing to bring Section 349 claim where the injury (loss of tax revenue) was merely derivative of the consumer's injury (thinking they were not paying sales tax on cigarettes).\nPlaintiffs claim fails for the additional and independent reason that the Defendants' products do not use Plaintiffs purported intellectual property, and also that Defendant's competing goods are clearly marked as such. Thus, Defendants cannot be alleged to have made improper use of Plaintiff s purported mark in connection with Defendants' watch.\nFinally, \"trademark or trade dress infringement claims ... fall outside the original intent of \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350 . . . \" U-Neek, Inc. v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 147 F Supp 2d 158, 176 (SDNY 2001).

In similar fashion, the Sixth Claim for relief for false advertising under New York General Business Law, the Seventh Claim for trademark infringement under New York Law (NY General Business Law \u00a7 360-k, 360-o) and the Eighth Claim for trademark dilution under New York Law (New York Anti-Dilutions Statute General Business Law \u00a7 360-1) must be dismissed, Besides, the Plaintiff never registered as a copyright or a trademark the phrase, \"wrap style watch.\" It registered the phrases \"W07 leather and chain wrap watch, W06 Second Strand Studded Wrap Watch, W40 Studded Leather and Chain Wrap Watch with braid, W12 Lambskin Woven Wrap Watch, and W44 Flat Chain Lambskin Woven Wrap Watch. The Plaintiff thus has no proprietary interest in the phrase. These words are purely descriptive and could never be registered in any event. The Plaintiff has failed to allege that either of the Defendants have palmed off their goods as that of the Plaintiff. With this omission, there is no basis to support a finding of trade dress infringement or copyright infringement independent from the claim alleged under the Copyright Act. Sabline Prod, Inc. v. Geber Prod., Inc., 579 F.Supp. 248, 251 N.4 (S.D.N.Y. 1984). In addition, the Defendant NY & Co. clearly sets forth its name on the front and back of each watch. Under these facts, there could never be any legitimate claim of confusion or infringement.\nIn similar fashion, the claims set forth in the Fifth through Eighth Causes of Action under the New York General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350, 360 are all preempted by Federal Statutes. The Complaint alleges harms arising only from the Defendants' alleged copying of its designs, and asserts only claims that, at best, would fit within either the Federal Copyright Law.\nBased upon the foregoing, the Third through Eighth Claims of the Complaint must be dismissed since they are all preempted by federal statutes. Maurizio v. Goldsmith, 230 F.3d 518, 521 (2nd Cir. 2000).\nAssuming arguendo that the Plaintiff was entitled to protection under the Copyright or Trademark Acts (which the Defendants do not concede), one may market a product identical to a copyrighted work so long as the second comer designed his product independently.

With the state of the law, as described above, and since the sale and marketing of wrap watches by the Defendants preceded the registration by the Plaintiff, it is more likely that Classic Time would have a claim for infringement of its common law rights against the Plaintiff, since, unquestionably, the Plaintiff has, in fact, copied the Classic Time designs and concepts.\nSince the Exhibits attached to the Marc Smouha and Jack S.

Thus, simply put, the antidilution statute focuses on the harm to a mark, even absent any confusion or fraud in the marketplace.\"  That court held that the Lanham Act does not preempt New York's antidilution statute.\nIn the instant matter, Sara Designs alleges that they hold a senior mark with respect to the trade dress of the \"wrap style watch\" designs (Exhibit D & E to the Complaint), that New York & Company duplicated nearly all of the constituent elements and overall design of the \"wrap style watch,\" and began to sell them en masse in their retail channels and over the internet in flagrant violation of Sara Designs rights.",

        "moving_content": "The Complaint emphasizes Kimberly-Clark's decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment based on Plaintiff's act of leaving a noose on company premises as if such reasoning supports an inference of unlawful discrimination.  It does not.  Title VII and Section 1981 prohibit employment discrimination based on race, but neither statute offers any protection to those who expose co-workers to racist symbols.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. See generally Storey v. Burns Int'l Sec. Servs., 390 F.3d 760, 765 (3d Cir. 2004) (affirming summary judgment for employer on Title VII claims brought by employee fired for refusing to cover or remove Confederate symbols on his automobile).  Indeed, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") has interpreted Title VII to allow claims of harassment against employers that fail to remove racist symbols from the workplace. See Dawson v. Donahoe, EEOC DOC 0120114186, 2012 WL 524010, at *1 (Feb. 8, 2012) (complainant who complained about coworkers wearing Confederate flag t-shirts, which he believed was \"a symbol of racism that evoked the history of slavery,\" stated a viable claim of discriminatory harassment based on the employer's failure to remove those symbols from the workplace).\nThere is simply no room for debate that a noose constitutes a racist symbol or that an employer may lawfully fire an employee for bringing a noose onto its property.  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas has explained this point well:\nA hangman's noose is a loathesome symbol of hatred in its most evil form, a relic of a terrible historical legacy of slavery, oppression, and mass murder, akin to the devilish symbols of a burning cross or a Nazi swastika.  A hangman's noose has no business in a workplace. It serves no purpose but to intimidate Black employees and remind them of a violent history of slavery, oppression, and mob lynchings during the most deplorable moments in America's tortured racial history, the remnants of which Title VII is designed to rectify and overcome.\nBrown v. Peterson, No. 7:03 CV 0205, 2006 WL 349805, at *9 (N.D. Tex., Feb. 3, 2006).  See id. at *8 (explaining that \"any reasonable person\" would perceive a noose to be a racist symbol). The Complaint admits that Plaintiff's co-workers specifically described the \"string\" that Plaintiff placed on Kimberly-Clark property as being a \"noose\" and that Kimberly-Clark fired him for \"leaving a racist symbol for public display.\"  Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 67-69, 80-87.  With these allegations, Plaintiff's own words preclude him from recovering under Title VII or Section 1981.\nIndeed, the Complaint confirms that, rather than violate Title VII or Section 1981, Kimberly- Clark's decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment actually furthered the important goals that those laws are designed to pursue. 1",

Of course, a conclusory assertion that race motivated his firing would not be enough to survive dismissal, but Plaintiff failed to muster even such a threadbare averment. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Raj v. Louisiana State Univ., 714 F.3d 322, 331 (5th Cir. 2013) (affirming the grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, reasoning that the plaintiff \"did not allege any facts, direct or circumstantial, that would suggest [the challenged] actions were based on...race or national origin or that...similarly situated employees of other races or national origin [were treated] more favorably\"). In fact, Plaintiff's allegation that \"[a]ccording to [Kimberly-Clark's] employment records, Smith's race is 'White' or 'Caucasian,'\" see Compl., \u00b6 20, serves as the only mention of Plaintiff's race in the entire Complaint.\nFurthermore, Plaintiff failed to allege any facts on which the Court could infer discrimination.  Courts rely on the same well-established analytical framework to determine whether circumstantial evidence exists to support an inference of unlawful discrimination under both Title VII and Section 1981.  See McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir. 2007) (applying the burden-shifting framework announced McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green); LaPierre v. Benson Nissan, Inc., 86 F.3d 444, 448 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"Claims of racial discrimination brought under \u00a7 1981 are governed by the same evidentiary framework applicable to claims of employment discrimination brought under Title VII.\").\nUnder that framework, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that he (1) is a member of a protected group; (2) was qualified for the position held; (3) suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4) was treated less favorably than someone outside his protected group.  See McCoy, 492 F.3d at 556.  Nothing in the Complaint identifies or even references any non-Caucasian employee whom Plaintiff claims Kimberly- Clark treated more favorably than Plaintiff under \"nearly identical circumstances.\"  See Lee v. Kansas City S Ry. Co., 574 F.3d 253, 260 (5th Cir. 2009).  This pleading failure is fatal to Plaintiff's claims.  See Williams v. City of Austin, 170 F. Supp. 3d 939, 949 (W.D.

Appx. 333, 335 (5th Cir. 2014) (affirming dismissal of discrimination claims where the plaintiff did \"not allege that her position was filled by an individual outside her class or that she was treated less favorably\"); Puente v.

The absence of such allegations reinforces that Plaintiff's discrimination claims must fail as a matter of law.  See Smith v. Dallas County Hosp.

        "moving_content": "Finally, Plaintiff's suggestion that Kimberly-Clark reached the wrong conclusion in deciding that the \"string\" Plaintiff admits placing on Kimberly-Clark's property was a \"noose,\" is inconsequential.  Such a quibble with an employer's judgment cannot support a discrimination claim. See Landavazo v. The Toro Company, 301 Fed. Appx. 333, 2008 WL 5111078 (5th Cir. 2008) (affirming dismissal and reasoning that an \"allegation that the purported reason [for an employer's decision] is false, pretextual and a mere excuse for unlawful motivations is, at most, a conclusory allegation and provides no notice of Toro's acts that gives rise to this action.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  See also Balazs v. Liebenthal, 32 F.3d 151, 155 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"An allegation that he was falsely accused of [sexual harassment] which, if true, might have given rise to a claim of employment discrimination based on sex by someone else in no way states a cause of action that plaintiff himself was a victim of discrimination based on his sex.\"); Albert v. DeBartolo, 1993 WL 272477, at *8 (6th Cir. July 20, 1993) (\"Plaintiff's true complaint is that he was wrongfully discharged because of false accusations of sexual harassment, a claim that is not cognizable under Title VII.\").\nSimilarly, to the extent the Complaint can be read to suggest Plaintiff's belief that Kimberly-Clark's investigation resulting in his termination was somehow flawed, Plaintiff cannot rely on such a belief to escape dismissal of his claims.  Simply put, neither Title VII nor Section 1981 will impose liability on an employer for terminating an employee based on a belief that the employee acted improperly - even if that belief arose from the employer's mistakes or flawed investigation.  See Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir. 1994) (the issue is \"whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent\"); Pollis v.

None of these conditions are satisfied here.\nThis coverage issue must be viewed in the context of the purpose of exclusions like exclusion J.\nThe primary focus of the exclusion is to prevent collusive suits in which an insured company might seek to force its insurer to pay for the poor business decisions of its officers or managers. The exclusion arose from a wave of litigation in the mid-1980's when corporations attempted to use their Director and Officer policies to recoup operational losses.\nTownship of Center, Butler County, Pa. v. First Mercury Syndicate, Inc., 117 F.3d 115, 119 (11 th Cir. 1997).  Philadelphia acknowledges the rationale for the exclusion. Here, there is no suggestion that the Receiver's suit against Corbishley and Bentley is collusive. Plainly, this is not the type of claim that exclusion J was intended to exclude.\nPhiladelphia itself makes this crystal-clear by its own limitation of the exclusion (sometimes referred to as a carveback) found in the \"Amendment of Exclusions\" section of the endorsement to the D&O policy referred to by Philadelphia as a \"Pro-Pak Elite Enhancement.\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 50-55.)  Item E of the Amendment of Exclusions provides that \"Item J. will not apply to any claim brought as a derivative action, or similar action, on behalf of the Organization, provided the claim is brought without the assistance of any current or former Individual Insured.\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 52)   Therefore, a claim will be covered even if it is brought \"on behalf\" of ProCAP, as long as it is in the nature of a derivative claim and no individual insured helps prosecute the claim.  In this carveback, Philadelphia clarifies and limits the purpose of exclusion J to exclude coverage only in situations involving collusive lawsuits.",

Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 11 A.3d 1078,1083 (R.I. 2010)). \"The Court considers the policy in its entirety and does not establish ambiguity by viewing a word in isolation or by taking a phrase out of context.\" Id. A contract is not ambiguous \"merely because the parties disagree over its proper interpretation.\" Peerless Ins. Co. v. Luppe, 118 A.3d 500, 506 (R.I. 2015). Moreover, to the extent that there is a conflict between the original terms of a policy and a policy endorsement, the policy endorsement controls. Cheaters, Inc. v. United Nat. Ins. Co., 41 A.3d 637, 644 n.9 (R.I. 2012). Applying these principles to the Policy shows that the plain language of Exclusion J precludes coverage for the Underlying Claim.\nExclusion J provides that Philadelphia \"shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss in connection with any Claim made against the Insured ... brought or maintained by, at the behest, or on behalf of the Organization.\" This type of exclusion is frequently called an \"Insured v. Insured\" exclusion, which is generally intended to \"exclude coverage both of collusive suits - such as suits in which a corporation sues its officers or directors in an effort to recoup the consequences of their business mistakes, . . . thus turning liability insurance into business-loss insurance - and of suits arising out of those particularly bitter disputes that erupt when members of a corporate ... family have a falling out and fall to quarreling.\" Level 3 Communications, Inc. v. Federal Insurance Co., 168 F.3d 956, 958 (7th Cir. 1999). See also Township of Center, Butler County, Pa. v. First Mercury Syndicate, Inc., 117 F.3d 115, 119 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"The primary focus of the exclusion is to prevent collusive suits in which an insured company might seek to force its insurer to pay for the poor business decisions of its officers or managers.\").\nThe Policy defines \"Organization\" to mean ProCAP, and the parties agreed that Corbishley and Bentley are Insureds. There could be no dispute that Exclusion J would exclude coverage for the Underlying Claim, a \"Claim,\" if ProCAP's name appeared first in its caption, rather than the Receiver's. The Defendants, therefore, argue that, by electing to bring the Underlying Claim in the Receiver's name rather than ProCAP's, Hemmendinger evades Exclusion J's effect.",
        "response_heading": "III. Argument",
        "response_content": "Exclusion J bars coverage here only if the Receiver's claim against Corbishley and Bentley has been \"brought or maintained by, at the behest, or on behalf of the Organization.\" Therefore, for coverage to be excluded, one of three tests must be satisfied: the claim must have been (1) brought or maintained by ProCAP; (2) brought or maintained at the behest of ProCAP; or (3) brought or maintained on behalf of ProCAP.  None of these conditions are satisfied here.\nThis coverage issue must be viewed in the context of the purpose of exclusions like exclusion J.\nThe primary focus of the exclusion is to prevent collusive suits in which an insured company might seek to force its insurer to pay for the poor business decisions of its officers or managers. The exclusion arose from a wave of litigation in the mid-1980's when corporations attempted to use their Director and Officer policies to recoup operational losses.\nTownship of Center, Butler County, Pa. v. First Mercury Syndicate, Inc., 117 F.3d 115, 119 (11 th Cir. 1997).  Philadelphia acknowledges the rationale for the exclusion. Here, there is no suggestion that the Receiver's suit against Corbishley and Bentley is collusive. Plainly, this is not the type of claim that exclusion J was intended to exclude.\nPhiladelphia itself makes this crystal-clear by its own limitation of the exclusion (sometimes referred to as a carveback) found in the \"Amendment of Exclusions\" section of the endorsement to the D&O policy referred to by Philadelphia as a \"Pro-Pak Elite Enhancement.\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 50-55.)  Item E of the Amendment of Exclusions provides that \"Item J. will not apply to any claim brought as a derivative action, or similar action, on behalf of the Organization, provided the claim is brought without the assistance of any current or former Individual Insured.\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 52)   Therefore, a claim will be covered even if it is brought \"on behalf\" of ProCAP, as long as it is in the nature of a derivative claim and no individual insured helps prosecute the claim.  In this carveback, Philadelphia clarifies and limits the purpose of exclusion J to exclude coverage only in situations involving collusive lawsuits.",

        "moving_heading": "1. The Policy's Own Terms Show that Hemmendinger Acts On Behalf of ProCAP in His Role as Receiver",
        "moving_content": "The Policy itself, as well as ProCAP's representations to Philadelphia, prove that Hemmendinger was acting \"on behalf of\" ProCAP in his role as Receiver. After Hemmendinger assumed control of ProCAP, ProCAP's broker represented to Philadelphia that Hemmendinger would be making all decisions regarding ProCAP in his role as Receiver, and needed to be covered under its D&O policy. Thus, the Policy was amended to identify Hemmendinger as an \"an individual who is contracted to perform services for the Organization.\" In plain language, however, \"for\" means \"on behalf of.\" See, e.g, American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 686 (4th Ed. 2000) (defining \"for\" as \"on behalf of'); Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 481 (1991) (same); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 886 (1986) (defining \"for\" as \"in behalf of'); 1 Compact Edition oft he Oxford English Dictionary 1047 (1971) (\"for\" means \"representing; as representative of' or \"in place of; instead of').

Cir. 2011) (\"The plain meaning of 'for' means 'on behalf of.'\"). Because the Policy must be read as a coherent whole, the Policy's endorsement identifying Hemmendinger as someone who would perform services \"for\" ProCAP shows that the Policy considers his actions as a Receiver to be made \"on behalf of' ProCAP when considering any actions taken by ProCAP becomes relevant to interpreting the Policy - e.g., Exclusion J. Accordingly, the Policy's plain meaning establishes that Hemmendinger is acting on behalf of ProCAP in his role as the Receiver. Exclusion J, therefore, applies to the Underlying Claim.",
        "response_heading": "B. The Receiver's claim has not been brought or maintained at the behest of ProCAP.",
        "response_content": "Since the phrase \"at the behest\" is not defined in the policy, and is not ambiguous, it should be given its commonly understood meaning. \"Behest\" is defined as \"A person's orders or command\" (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/behest) or \"an authoritative order: command\" or \"an urgent prompting\" (http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/behest).\nIf the Receiver has brought the claim at the \"behest\" of anyone, it was at the behest of the Superior Court, which created the receivership, empowered the Receiver as an agent of the court, and vested the Receiver with the title to \"all assets, property, choses in action, and any rights of [ProCAP].\" (ECF No. 18-5, \u00b6 3 (emphasis added)).  Since the undisputed facts establish that the Receiver has brought the claim pursuant to his court-appointed role and duties, and based on his own investigation and analysis of ProCAP's affairs (Affidavit of Thomas S. Hemmendinger, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7), the exclusion for claims brought \"at the behest\" of ProCAP does not apply. C. The Receiver's claim has not been brought or maintained \"on behalf of\" ProCAP. In Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp, 80 F.Supp.3d 923 (N.D.\nIowa 2015) the court rejected an argument that the FDIC, in a director and officer liability claim brought in its capacity as receiver of a failed bank, was acting \"on behalf of\" the failed bank so as to trigger a coverage exclusion similar to Philadelphia's exclusion J. Noting that \"behalf\" has been defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"On the part of (another), in the name of, as the agent or representative of, on account of, for, instead of. (With the notion of an official agency.),\" 80 F.Supp. 3d at 948, the court concluded that it found \"no basis to graft onto this interpretation of \"on behalf of . . . the Company\" an action by a receiver or other successor.\"  Id. The same result should obtain here. The receiver here is not acting \"on behalf of\" ProCAP when he sued ProCAP's former directors and officers any more than the FDIC as receiver was acting \"on behalf of\" the failed bank when it sued the bank's directors and officers. To the contrary, as a matter of Rhode Island law, he is acting as agent of, and on behalf of, the Providence County Superior Court.  The claim itself has been transferred by and from the Court to the Receiver so, to the extent that ProCAP even remains in existence, 3 it no longer possesses, and could not sue to enforce, the claim on which the receiver is suing. And, like all receivership assets, the chose in action remains in custodia legis until the Receiver disposes of it.  Manchester v. Manchester, supra.  Since ProCAP has been stripped of any rights it had in the claim, and the claim is in custodia legis, the Receiver cannot be asserting it \"on behalf of\" ProCAP. Philadelphia raises three arguments (Memorandum, pp. 10-13) in an attempt to demonstrate some identity or equivalency between the Receiver and ProCAP.  It argues (1) that the Receiver's addition by Philadelphia to the policy as an \"independent contractor\" insured means that the Receiver is acting on behalf of ProCAP; (2) that because a receiver has been described as standing in the shoes of the failed corporation in certain contexts, his actions are \"on behalf of\" that corporation; and (3) that the Receiver has admitted that he is acting \"on behalf of\" ProCAP.  None of these arguments holds water.\nThe circumstances surrounding Philadelphia's addition of the Receiver to the policy as an \"independent contractor\" show that this action was erroneous and should have no bearing on the application of exclusion J. First, the Receiver did not need, 4 request, or agree to his addition to the ProCAP D&O policy as an \"independent contractor\".  Affidavit of Thomas S. Hemmendinger at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4.  Therefore, there was never the mutual assent or \"meeting of the minds\" that is necessary for the formation of a binding agreement.  See Opella v. Opella, 896 A.2d 714, 720 (R.I. 2006).\nSecond, the email correspondence between Andrew Troy and the Philadelphia underwriter regarding the Receiver shows that the underwriter didn't understand either who the Receiver was or how to add him to the D&O policy. (ECF No. 18-3 at p. 3.)  The error by the underwriter in adding the Receiver to the policy as a so-called \"independent contractor\" is apparent from the policy's definition of that term: \"Independent Contractor means an individual who is contracted to perform services for the Organization . . .\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 3.)  Of course, the Receiver was never \"contracted to perform services for [ProCAP].\"   Rather, he was appointed by the Superior Court to act as its agent to marshal the assets of ProCAP and satisfy the claims of its creditors.  Since the Receiver was never an independent contractor for ProCAP and never \"perform[ed] services for the Organization,\" his erroneous addition to the policy as an independent contractor cannot transform his court-officer status into action \"on behalf of\" ProCAP.\nPhiladelphia is in the business of issuing D&O policies, and because it mentions receivers in another part of the policy, Philadelphia should have known better than to suggest that the Receiver should be-or even could be-an independent contractor. Philadelphia should not be allowed to use its own underwriting error to avoid coverage in this sleight-of-hand way. Moreover, but for Philadelphia's unwarranted addition of the Receiver to the policy as an independent contractor, the Amendment of Exclusions Item E would make it clear that exclusion J does not apply.  The Receiver's claim is in the nature of a derivative action, and if Philadelphia had not added the Receiver as an independent contractor, the claim would be \"brought without the assistance of any current or former Individual Insured.\" Since the addition of the Receiver should be given no legal effect, the carveback in Amendment of Exclusions Item E makes it clear that exclusion J does not apply to the Receiver's claim.\nPhiladelphia's \"stand in the shoes\" argument must also fail. None of the cases cited by Philadelphia stands for the proposition that because a receiver may metaphorically stand in the shoes of an entity, he assumes a legal identity with the corporation in receivership for all purposes, including the meaning and application of insurance clauses like exclusion J. The \"stand in the shoes\" metaphor means only that the Receiver's claim against Corbishley and Bentley is only as good on the merits as ProCAP's claim against Corbishley and Bentley would have been if there had never been a receivership.  All the Rhode Island cases cited by Philadelphia in support of its \"stand in the shoes\" argument stand only for the basic proposition that a receiver \"succeeds only to the debtor's rights, and takes the property subject to the claims, liens and equities which would affect the debtor if he himself were asserting his interest in the property.\"  Vitterito v. Sportsman's Lodge & Restaurant, Inc., 102 R.I. 72, 79, 228 A.2d 119, 124-125 (1967), citing Ryder v. Ryder, 19 R.I. 188, 32 A. 919 (1895). Paine v. Schenectady Ins. Co., 11 R.I. 411 414 (1877), relied upon by Philadelphia, is not even on point. It stands only for the proposition that a judgment in favor of the receiver has the same legal effect as a judgment by the corporation in receivership for res judicata purposes. Neither Paine nor any of the other cases cited by Philadelphia that use the \"stand in the shoes\" metaphor support the proposition that a receiver who sues former directors of a corporation in receivership is acting on behalf of the corporation for purposes of an insurance provision like exclusion J.   See Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp, 80 F.Supp.3d at 949 (That FDIC may step into the shoes of a failed financial institution is not equivalent to it acting \"on behalf of\" the institution when it sues institution's directors and officers.).\nWhile the Receiver here may not have any rights or claims against Corbishley and Bentley greater than those that ProCAP would have had outside the receivership, the decisive point is that he now has those rights, not ProCAP. After the Superior Court's appointment order transferred all of ProCAP's assets, property, and choses in action to the Receiver, he and he alone could assert the claims that formerly belonged to ProCAP. Since all of ProCAP's claims are now in custodia legis and the Superior Court has empowered the receiver to assert them, it was impossible for the Receiver, when he asserted one of those claims, to be acting on behalf of ProCAP. Whether the receiver metaphorically stands in ProCAP's shoes for purposes of determining the breadth of those claims does not change this reality.\nFinally, Philadelphia's argument that the Receiver has admitted that he is suing on behalf of ProCAP ignores statements by the Receiver that say just the opposite. For example, when counsel for the Receiver wrote to Philadelphia on February 22, 2012, he stated that \"the Receiver is aware of potential claims he may have as Receiver\" against ProCAP's former executive director. (ECF No. 18-6 (emphasis added)). When he filed his Complaint against Corbishley and Bentley in Superior Court, that pleading, which is the most important and  determinative characterization of the nature of the Receiver's claim, indicates that the Receiver was bringing the claim in his capacity as Receiver and because \"[a]s Receiver of ProCAP, plaintiff is empowered and authorized, as the agent of the Court, to assert claims for damages against any parties who may be liable to ProCAP for damages, including [Corbishley and Bentley].\" While the claims may not now be any more or less than they were when they belonged to ProCAP, those claims now belong to the Receiver, and he has made it clear that he is asserting his claim against Corbishley and Bentley in his own right as Receiver, not on behalf of ProCAP.",

Thus, according to the terms of the Receiver's appointment, the Rhode Island Superior Court granted him only \"the title to all assets, property, choses in action, and any rights of [ProCAP]\" - and nothing more.

Howsoever the Underlying Claim is captioned, the Receiver's asserted right to recovery is brought on behalf of ProCAP and, therefore, must be subject to all the rights and disabilities that ProCAP would face outside of receivership.\nBecause it is clear - as a matter of express Policy language, Rhode Island law, and the Receiver ' s judicial admissions - that the Underlying Claim was brought by, at the behest of, and/or on behalf of ProCAP, Exclusion J applies to preclude any coverage for Corbishley and Bentley.",
        "response_heading": "B. The Receiver's claim has not been brought or maintained at the behest of ProCAP.",
        "response_content": "Since the phrase \"at the behest\" is not defined in the policy, and is not ambiguous, it should be given its commonly understood meaning. \"Behest\" is defined as \"A person's orders or command\" (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/behest) or \"an authoritative order: command\" or \"an urgent prompting\" (http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/behest).\nIf the Receiver has brought the claim at the \"behest\" of anyone, it was at the behest of the Superior Court, which created the receivership, empowered the Receiver as an agent of the court, and vested the Receiver with the title to \"all assets, property, choses in action, and any rights of [ProCAP].\" (ECF No. 18-5, \u00b6 3 (emphasis added)).  Since the undisputed facts establish that the Receiver has brought the claim pursuant to his court-appointed role and duties, and based on his own investigation and analysis of ProCAP's affairs (Affidavit of Thomas S. Hemmendinger, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7), the exclusion for claims brought \"at the behest\" of ProCAP does not apply. C. The Receiver's claim has not been brought or maintained \"on behalf of\" ProCAP. In Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp, 80 F.Supp.3d 923 (N.D.\nIowa 2015) the court rejected an argument that the FDIC, in a director and officer liability claim brought in its capacity as receiver of a failed bank, was acting \"on behalf of\" the failed bank so as to trigger a coverage exclusion similar to Philadelphia's exclusion J. Noting that \"behalf\" has been defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"On the part of (another), in the name of, as the agent or representative of, on account of, for, instead of. (With the notion of an official agency.),\" 80 F.Supp. 3d at 948, the court concluded that it found \"no basis to graft onto this interpretation of \"on behalf of . . . the Company\" an action by a receiver or other successor.\"  Id. The same result should obtain here. The receiver here is not acting \"on behalf of\" ProCAP when he sued ProCAP's former directors and officers any more than the FDIC as receiver was acting \"on behalf of\" the failed bank when it sued the bank's directors and officers. To the contrary, as a matter of Rhode Island law, he is acting as agent of, and on behalf of, the Providence County Superior Court.  The claim itself has been transferred by and from the Court to the Receiver so, to the extent that ProCAP even remains in existence, 3 it no longer possesses, and could not sue to enforce, the claim on which the receiver is suing. And, like all receivership assets, the chose in action remains in custodia legis until the Receiver disposes of it.  Manchester v. Manchester, supra.  Since ProCAP has been stripped of any rights it had in the claim, and the claim is in custodia legis, the Receiver cannot be asserting it \"on behalf of\" ProCAP. Philadelphia raises three arguments (Memorandum, pp. 10-13) in an attempt to demonstrate some identity or equivalency between the Receiver and ProCAP.  It argues (1) that the Receiver's addition by Philadelphia to the policy as an \"independent contractor\" insured means that the Receiver is acting on behalf of ProCAP; (2) that because a receiver has been described as standing in the shoes of the failed corporation in certain contexts, his actions are \"on behalf of\" that corporation; and (3) that the Receiver has admitted that he is acting \"on behalf of\" ProCAP.  None of these arguments holds water.\nThe circumstances surrounding Philadelphia's addition of the Receiver to the policy as an \"independent contractor\" show that this action was erroneous and should have no bearing on the application of exclusion J. First, the Receiver did not need, 4 request, or agree to his addition to the ProCAP D&O policy as an \"independent contractor\".  Affidavit of Thomas S. Hemmendinger at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4.  Therefore, there was never the mutual assent or \"meeting of the minds\" that is necessary for the formation of a binding agreement.  See Opella v. Opella, 896 A.2d 714, 720 (R.I. 2006).\nSecond, the email correspondence between Andrew Troy and the Philadelphia underwriter regarding the Receiver shows that the underwriter didn't understand either who the Receiver was or how to add him to the D&O policy. (ECF No. 18-3 at p. 3.)  The error by the underwriter in adding the Receiver to the policy as a so-called \"independent contractor\" is apparent from the policy's definition of that term: \"Independent Contractor means an individual who is contracted to perform services for the Organization . . .\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 3.)  Of course, the Receiver was never \"contracted to perform services for [ProCAP].\"   Rather, he was appointed by the Superior Court to act as its agent to marshal the assets of ProCAP and satisfy the claims of its creditors.  Since the Receiver was never an independent contractor for ProCAP and never \"perform[ed] services for the Organization,\" his erroneous addition to the policy as an independent contractor cannot transform his court-officer status into action \"on behalf of\" ProCAP.\nPhiladelphia is in the business of issuing D&O policies, and because it mentions receivers in another part of the policy, Philadelphia should have known better than to suggest that the Receiver should be-or even could be-an independent contractor. Philadelphia should not be allowed to use its own underwriting error to avoid coverage in this sleight-of-hand way. Moreover, but for Philadelphia's unwarranted addition of the Receiver to the policy as an independent contractor, the Amendment of Exclusions Item E would make it clear that exclusion J does not apply.  The Receiver's claim is in the nature of a derivative action, and if Philadelphia had not added the Receiver as an independent contractor, the claim would be \"brought without the assistance of any current or former Individual Insured.\" Since the addition of the Receiver should be given no legal effect, the carveback in Amendment of Exclusions Item E makes it clear that exclusion J does not apply to the Receiver's claim.\nPhiladelphia's \"stand in the shoes\" argument must also fail. None of the cases cited by Philadelphia stands for the proposition that because a receiver may metaphorically stand in the shoes of an entity, he assumes a legal identity with the corporation in receivership for all purposes, including the meaning and application of insurance clauses like exclusion J. The \"stand in the shoes\" metaphor means only that the Receiver's claim against Corbishley and Bentley is only as good on the merits as ProCAP's claim against Corbishley and Bentley would have been if there had never been a receivership.  All the Rhode Island cases cited by Philadelphia in support of its \"stand in the shoes\" argument stand only for the basic proposition that a receiver \"succeeds only to the debtor's rights, and takes the property subject to the claims, liens and equities which would affect the debtor if he himself were asserting his interest in the property.\"  Vitterito v. Sportsman's Lodge & Restaurant, Inc., 102 R.I. 72, 79, 228 A.2d 119, 124-125 (1967), citing Ryder v. Ryder, 19 R.I. 188, 32 A. 919 (1895). Paine v. Schenectady Ins. Co., 11 R.I. 411 414 (1877), relied upon by Philadelphia, is not even on point. It stands only for the proposition that a judgment in favor of the receiver has the same legal effect as a judgment by the corporation in receivership for res judicata purposes. Neither Paine nor any of the other cases cited by Philadelphia that use the \"stand in the shoes\" metaphor support the proposition that a receiver who sues former directors of a corporation in receivership is acting on behalf of the corporation for purposes of an insurance provision like exclusion J.   See Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp, 80 F.Supp.3d at 949 (That FDIC may step into the shoes of a failed financial institution is not equivalent to it acting \"on behalf of\" the institution when it sues institution's directors and officers.).\nWhile the Receiver here may not have any rights or claims against Corbishley and Bentley greater than those that ProCAP would have had outside the receivership, the decisive point is that he now has those rights, not ProCAP. After the Superior Court's appointment order transferred all of ProCAP's assets, property, and choses in action to the Receiver, he and he alone could assert the claims that formerly belonged to ProCAP. Since all of ProCAP's claims are now in custodia legis and the Superior Court has empowered the receiver to assert them, it was impossible for the Receiver, when he asserted one of those claims, to be acting on behalf of ProCAP. Whether the receiver metaphorically stands in ProCAP's shoes for purposes of determining the breadth of those claims does not change this reality.\nFinally, Philadelphia's argument that the Receiver has admitted that he is suing on behalf of ProCAP ignores statements by the Receiver that say just the opposite. For example, when counsel for the Receiver wrote to Philadelphia on February 22, 2012, he stated that \"the Receiver is aware of potential claims he may have as Receiver\" against ProCAP's former executive director. (ECF No. 18-6 (emphasis added)). When he filed his Complaint against Corbishley and Bentley in Superior Court, that pleading, which is the most important and  determinative characterization of the nature of the Receiver's claim, indicates that the Receiver was bringing the claim in his capacity as Receiver and because \"[a]s Receiver of ProCAP, plaintiff is empowered and authorized, as the agent of the Court, to assert claims for damages against any parties who may be liable to ProCAP for damages, including [Corbishley and Bentley].\" While the claims may not now be any more or less than they were when they belonged to ProCAP, those claims now belong to the Receiver, and he has made it clear that he is asserting his claim against Corbishley and Bentley in his own right as Receiver, not on behalf of ProCAP.",

        "moving_content": "Under Rhode Island law, when the insurer demonstrates the applicability of a policy exclusion, the burden of showing that a claim falls within an exception to the exclusion shifts back to the policyholder. See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Warwick Dyeing Corp., 26 F.3d 1195 (1st Cir. 1994); Lifespan Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA, 59 F.Supp.3d 427, 440 (D.R.1.2014). There is only one potentially applicable exception to Exclusion J. The Policy's Pro-Pak Elite Enhancement Endorsement provides that Exclusion J \"will not apply to any claim brought as a derivative action, or similar action, on behalf of the Organization, provided the claim is brought without the assistance of any current or former Individual Insured.\" Irrespective of whether the Underlying Claim could plausibly be characterized as similar to a derivative action, it clearly was brought with Hemmendinger's assistance. Because Hemmendinger is specifically named in the Policy as an Individual Insured, and Defendants already have admitted this fact in their Answers, Defendants cannot demonstrate that this exception applies.",
        "response_heading": "III. Argument",
        "response_content": "Exclusion J bars coverage here only if the Receiver's claim against Corbishley and Bentley has been \"brought or maintained by, at the behest, or on behalf of the Organization.\" Therefore, for coverage to be excluded, one of three tests must be satisfied: the claim must have been (1) brought or maintained by ProCAP; (2) brought or maintained at the behest of ProCAP; or (3) brought or maintained on behalf of ProCAP.  None of these conditions are satisfied here.\nThis coverage issue must be viewed in the context of the purpose of exclusions like exclusion J.\nThe primary focus of the exclusion is to prevent collusive suits in which an insured company might seek to force its insurer to pay for the poor business decisions of its officers or managers. The exclusion arose from a wave of litigation in the mid-1980's when corporations attempted to use their Director and Officer policies to recoup operational losses.\nTownship of Center, Butler County, Pa. v. First Mercury Syndicate, Inc., 117 F.3d 115, 119 (11 th Cir. 1997).  Philadelphia acknowledges the rationale for the exclusion. Here, there is no suggestion that the Receiver's suit against Corbishley and Bentley is collusive. Plainly, this is not the type of claim that exclusion J was intended to exclude.\nPhiladelphia itself makes this crystal-clear by its own limitation of the exclusion (sometimes referred to as a carveback) found in the \"Amendment of Exclusions\" section of the endorsement to the D&O policy referred to by Philadelphia as a \"Pro-Pak Elite Enhancement.\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 50-55.)  Item E of the Amendment of Exclusions provides that \"Item J. will not apply to any claim brought as a derivative action, or similar action, on behalf of the Organization, provided the claim is brought without the assistance of any current or former Individual Insured.\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 52)   Therefore, a claim will be covered even if it is brought \"on behalf\" of ProCAP, as long as it is in the nature of a derivative claim and no individual insured helps prosecute the claim.  In this carveback, Philadelphia clarifies and limits the purpose of exclusion J to exclude coverage only in situations involving collusive lawsuits.",

        "response_heading": "A.   The Receiver's state court claim has not been brought by ProCAP.",
        "response_content": "The word \"Organization\" in exclusion J appears in bold type, which indicates that the term is defined in the policy. The definition appears in Part 6 (\"Common Policy Definitions\"). In relevant part, it states, \"Organization means:  1. the Parent Organization, 2. any Subsidiary . . .\"\n(ECF No. 18-1 at p.36).  \"Parent Organization\" itself is defined simply to mean \"the first entity named in item 1 of the Declarations Page\" (ECF No. 18-1 at p. 13); \"item 1\" states that the parent organization is Providence Community Action Program. 2    Significantly, neither exclusion J nor the definition of \"Organization\" mentions a receiver or any other type of successor in interest. If Philadelphia intended to include claims by receivers when it barred claims by \"the Organization,\" it would have been a simple matter to either define \"Organization\" to include receivers or receiverships, or to include such entities in the exclusion itself, as other insurance companies have done.  For example, in Bancsure, Inc. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corporation, 796 F.3d 1226, 1231 (10 th Cir. 2015), the policy excluded coverage for \"a Claim by, or on behalf of, or at the behest of, any other Insured Person, the Company, or any successor, trustee, assignee or receiver of the Company. . ..\"  Since receiverships are mentioned in the policy (exclusion G bars coverage for any losses arising out of the receivership of any bank or other investment or insurance company) the concept of a receivership was certainly known to Philadelphia.  The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from Philadelphia's failure to use a broader exclusion or a broader definition of Organization is that Philadelphia meant \"the Organization\" to mean ProCAP and only ProCAP.  Its failure to either include receivers in exclusion J or define \"Organization\" to include receivers is fatal to any argument that Receiver's claim is a claim by \"the Organization.\"\nThe Receiver's state court complaint (ECF No. 18-9) demonstrates that the claim has not been brought by ProCAP. The Receiver states in the caption and the first paragraph of the Complaint that he is suing in his capacity as Receiver of ProCAP. Moreover, in paragraph 9, the Receiver states that he is asserting his claim under the power and authority he possesses as an agent of the Superior Court. He does not base his claim on any relationship with ProCAP. Therefore, the Receiver has made it clear that his authority to bring this action is based not on any identity or relation with ProCAP, but rather on his judicially-authorized status as an appointed agent of the Court.\nSince the claim has been brought by and in the name of the Receiver, and not by ProCAP, and since the policy does not define \"Organization\" to include a court-appointed receiver, the first test of the exclusion, that the claim must have been \"brought or maintained by . . . [ProCAP],\" is not satisfied.",
