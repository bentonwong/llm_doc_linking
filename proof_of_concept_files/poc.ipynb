    "Objective\n",
    "This project aims to analyze legal briefs by linking argument sections between \"moving briefs\"\n",
    "and \"response briefs\" filed in court cases. The focus is on identifying and matching arguments\n",
    "from the initial brief with corresponding counter-arguments in the response. Automating this\n",
    "analysis will help aiding in legal research and argument drafting.\n",
    "Brief documents are filed by plaintiff / defendant attorneys to argue their stance in support /\n",
    "opposition of a motion. These briefs are filed in a back-and-forth fashion until the judge passes\n",
    "an order on the motion. Briefs contain various section types: introduction, standard of review,\n",
    "factual summary, argument sections, conclusion, etc. Arguments form the crux of a brief.\n",
    "You are presented with a list of argument sections extracted from a list of brief pairs. The first\n",
    "brief in every brief pair is called the ‚Äúmoving brief‚Äù and the second brief in the pair is called the\n",
    "‚Äúresponse brief‚Äù\n",
    ", since it is filed in response to the moving brief. Your task is to link argument\n",
    "sections from the moving brief to those in the response brief, thereby getting the set of counter\n",
    "arguments (from the response brief) for every argument in the moving brief. Every argument in\n",
    "the moving brief can have multiple counter arguments from the response brief."

      "holds an easement to construct and maintain a natural gas pipeline across each of the properties.\n",
      "Recently, MVP began construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline on Plaintiffs' properties. The\n",
      "Mountain Valley Pipeline is an approximately 300-mile-long pipeline running from Wetzel County, West\n",
      "Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Construction of the pipeline is conditioned on, among\n",
      "other things, a permit from the Virginia State Water Control Board (\"SWCB\") pursuant to Section 401\n",
      "of the Federal Clean Water Act. Under the Clean Water Act the SWCB must certify that construction\n",
      "and operation of the pipeline would not violate water quality standards. Moreover, the SWCB's permit\n",
      "made compliance with Virginia's erosion and sediment control statue and regulations a condition of\n",
      "the permit. The first phase of construction of the pipeline requires MVP to clear a 125-foot right-\n",
      "of- way of all vegetation and remove the topsoil. These initial construction activities exposed a\n",
      "layer of reddish clay below the topsoil. A steady rain began on May 15, 2018 and continued through\n",
      "May 19, dislodging large amounts of soil and mud from the denuded construction corridor. Soil and\n",
      "mud driven by rainwater runoff flowed down an exposed section of the easement on property adjacent\n",
      "to the Flora property. The soil and mud flowed across Cahas Mountain Road, which borders the Flora\n",
      "property, onto the Floras' hayfield and pasture and continued onto Little Creek, a stream that\n",
      "bisects the Floras' fields. The flow deposited soil and mud in the Floras' fields and in Little\n",
      "Creek. It also deposited about eight inches of mud on Cahas Mountain Road. Laurence Hammack,\n",

      "MVP to reevaluate the use of certain erosion control mechanisms in light of their recent\n",
      "catastrophic failures and DEQ has not insisted that MVP use more stringent erosion control measures.\n",
      "Instead DEQ has publicly, and wrongly, stated that no sediment from the MVP easements reached any\n",
      "streams. But the eyewitness accounts of Plaintiffs, contemporaneous evidence recorded during the\n",
      "rainstorms, and DEQ internal emails show that sediment runoff into streams near MVP's easements was\n",
      "significant, widespread and nearly uncontrolled. An email from DEQ employee Elizabeth Abe to another\n",
      "DEQ employee Matthew Grant explains that while driving on Brick Church Road in Rocky Mount, Virginia\n",
      "she observed a stream so choked with mud from an MVP easement that water was not flowing through the\n",
      "stream. Ex. A. She also observed that MVP had failed to erect any erosion controls on its easement.\n",
      "Id. For its part MVP has done little, if anything, to remedy the situation that led to large-scale\n",
      "mud deposition on Plaintiffs' properties. As of an inspection on May 28, 2018 MVP had not materially\n",
      "improved the erosion controls at any of the easements near Plaintiffs' properties. Silt fencing2\n",
      "located on MVP easements near the Flora and Frith properties are riddled with holes and collapsing.\n",
      "Some of the ground underneath the silt fences has eroded away, leaving room for runoff to pass\n",
      "unimpeded underneath the fence. Silt socks on the same easements are only staked to the ground, not\n",
      "embedded in it, such that water may pass freely underneath them as well. Those areas also lack silt\n",
      "socks with enough height to prevent water from spilling over the top of them, especially where some\n",
      "already have mud built up on them. Proof of those conditions will be supported by testimony as to\n",
      "the personal observations of the Plaintiffs on their properties, as supported by photographs,\n",
      "videos, and water samples they took and/or collected. MVP constructed sediment dikes on some of the\n",
      "easements, but the dikes are not compacted and thus they themselves are susceptible to eroding away,\n",
      "completely nullifying their erosion prevention function. Moreover, the dikes are not seeded with\n",
      "grass mats, further adding to the likelihood that they will erode when it next rains. Silt socks\n",
      "placed in gaps in silt fencing and at the outlets of the dikes are secured only by stakes and are\n",
      "undermined by erosion in some places. The next significant rain will exploit the weaknesses in the\n",
      "erosion controls and lead to additional trespasses on Plaintiffs' properties. Neither DEQ nor MVP\n",
      "have addressed these weaknesses and trespasses will continue until MVP is enjoined to remedy those\n",
      "weaknesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Argument 2: I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits ---\n",
      "Plaintiffs are likely to succeed the merits of their continuing trespass claim. MVP has shown that\n",
      "it has not been able to control the erosion and deposition of mud and soil from its easements onto\n",
      "Plaintiffs' properties, even during this early stage of construction. Even after its erosion\n",
      "controls failed on two separate occasions, MVP has not attempted to implement tighter controls or\n",
      "even fully repair the mediocre controls it has in place now. MVP's actions make it a near certainty\n",
      "that the next time there is a significant rain event, mud will erode from MVP's easements onto\n",
      "Plaintiffs' properties. Virginia common law defines trespass as \"an unauthorized entry onto property\n",
      "which results in interference with the property owner's possessory interests therein.\" Kurpiel v.\n",
      "Hicks, 731 S.E.2d 921, 925 (Va. 2012) (quoting Cooper v. Horn, 448 S.E.2d 403, 406 (Va. 1994)). That\n",
      "means \"a plaintiff must prove an invasion that interfered with the right of exclusive possession of\n",
      "the land . . . that was a direct result of some act committed by the defendant.\" Id.  Plaintiffs\n",
      "here seek only the vindication of the golden rule of property law: \"[t]he law requires that every\n",
      "person so use his own property as not to injure the property of another.\" Cooper v. Horn, 448 S.E.2d\n",
      "403, 407 (Va. 1994). The power to exclude is one of the most treasured strands in an owner's bundle\n",

      "trespass that is \"committed by one against another [and] constantly repeated . . . .\" Boerner v.\n",
      "McCallister, 89 S.E.2d 23, 25 (Va. 1955). MVP has already committed a trespass against Plaintiffs\n",
      "property rights in their individual properties, and it is extremely likely the MVP will continue to\n",
      "trespass on Plaintiffs' properties when it rains. In fact, MVP has failed to implement erosion\n",
      "controls in a proper manner. MVP has failed to compact its sediment dikes and failed to seed them\n",
      "with grass. MVP also placed silt socks that are inadequate to absorb or redirect the mud-laden flow\n",
      "they receive. Additionally, MVP failed to repair holes in its erosion control mechanisms and erosion\n",
      "underneath those mechanisms and continues to use installation techniques that do not ensure the\n",
      "effectiveness of those controls. DEQ, although lax in its enforcement, is not charged with enforcing\n",
      "trespass law.4 It is, nevertheless, disheartening that DEQ stands idle while MVP refuses to\n",
      "implement effective erosion controls. Further, DEQ's public assessments of the scope of the erosion\n",
      "control failures are undercut by the observations of its own employees. DEQ has shown that by those\n",
      "and other actions that Plaintiffs cannot to rely on the Commonwealth to adequately protect their\n",
      "property rights. Plaintiffs are forced, therefore, to bring this action to ensure that their most\n",
      "fundamental property rights will be protected from MVP's failure to take the care and spend the\n",
      "money necessary to prevent its trespasses. As a result of MVP's slipshod attempt at erosion control\n",
      "and the lack of a plan to remedy the past failures of the same controls currently in place, MVP is\n",
      "nearly certain to continue to deposit mud and soil from its easements onto Plaintiffs' properties\n",
      "when it rains, thus constituting a continuing trespass on Plaintiffs' properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Argument 3: II. Imminent Irreparable Harm ---\n",
      "Absent an injunction Plaintiffs will suffer imminent and irreparable injury. MVP has been unable to\n",
      "prevent mud from being deposited on Plaintiffs' property and has taken few, if any, steps to prevent\n",
      "any future trespass on Plaintiffs' properties. Violations of Plaintiffs' property rights constitute\n",
      "an irreparable injury under Virginia law. In holding that an injunction is the appropriate remedy\n",
      "for enforcement of real property rights, the Virginia Supreme Court explained that \"the violation of\n",
      "a real property interest is deemed irreparable and the owner protected in the enjoyment of his\n",
      "property whether such be sentimental or pecuniary.\" Norfolk S. Ry. v. Breeden, 756 S.E.2d 420,\n",
      "424-25 (Va. 2014) (quoting Levisa Coal Co. v. Consolidation Coal Co., 662 S.E.2d 44, 54 (Va. 2008)).\n",
      "In the case of a continuing trespass, as Plaintiffs claim here, the Defendant's were in compliance\n",
      "with DEQ's requirements, which it is not, such compliance would not affect its duty to also comply\n",
      "with its common law obligations. continuing trespass may be enjoined even though each individual act\n",
      "of trespass is in itself trivial, or the damage is trifling, nominal or insubstantial, and despite\n",
      "the fact that no single trespass causes irreparable injury. The injury is deemed irreparable and the\n",
      "owner protected in the enjoyment of his property whether such be sentimental or pecuniary. Levisa\n",
      "Coal, 662 S.E.2d at 54 (quoting Boerner, 89 S.E.2d at 25). This is so because \"where an injury by\n",
      "one against another is being constantly repeated, so that the complainant's remedy at law requires\n",
      "the bringing of successive actions, the legal remedy is inadequate, and the trespass will be\n",
      "prevented in equity by an injunction, the prevention of a multiplicity of actions at law being one\n",
      "of the special grounds of equity jurisdiction.\" Boerner, 89 S.E.2d at 25. MVP's lack of effective\n",
      "erosion controls will likely result in future injuries to Plaintiffs' properties each time an\n",
      "appreciable amount of rain falls. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' injuries can only be remedied by an\n",
      "injunction barring future trespasses by MVP.\n",
      "\n",
