"{""brief_id"": ""X1Q6O43B7MO2"", ""brief_arguments"": [{""heading"": ""BACKGROUND"", ""content"": ""Plaintiffs own properties located in Franklin County, Virginia in the area around Boones Mill. MVP holds an easement to construct and maintain a natural gas pipeline across each of the properties. Recently, MVP began construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline on Plaintiffs' properties. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is an approximately 300-mile-long pipeline running from Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Construction of the pipeline is conditioned on, among other things, a permit from the Virginia State Water Control Board (\""SWCB\"") pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Clean Water Act. Under the Clean Water Act the SWCB must certify that construction and operation of the pipeline would not violate water quality standards. Moreover, the SWCB's permit made compliance with Virginia's erosion and sediment control statue and regulations a condition of the permit.\nThe first phase of construction of the pipeline requires MVP to clear a 125-foot right-of- way of all vegetation and remove the topsoil. These initial construction activities exposed a layer of reddish clay below the topsoil.\nA steady rain began on May 15, 2018 and continued through May 19, dislodging large amounts of soil and mud from the denuded construction corridor. Soil and mud driven by rainwater runoff flowed down an exposed section of the easement on property adjacent to the Flora property. The soil and mud flowed across Cahas Mountain Road, which borders the Flora property, onto the Floras' hayfield and pasture and continued onto Little Creek, a stream that bisects the Floras' fields. The flow deposited soil and mud in the Floras' fields and in Little Creek. It also deposited about eight inches of mud on Cahas Mountain Road. Laurence Hammack, Construction halted at Mountain Valley Pipeline worksite following severe erosion in Franklin County, The Roanoke Times (May 20, 2018), http://www.roanoke.com/business/constr uction-halted-at-mountain-valley-pipeline-work-site-following-severe/article_2eeebd3a-5007- 56b0-9469-3e381b09b668.html.\nAnother rainstorm passed through the Boones Mill area on May 26 and 27. Rain on those days washed three to four inches of mud and soil from the denuded easements on to the Friths' and Hurts' shared private driveway. The rains also washed mud and soil onto the Frith and Hurt properties, some of which ended up in an unnamed tributary that runs across both of their properties.\nPrior to the rain on May 15 through 19 and May 26 and 27, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (\""DEQ\"") stated that erosion and sediment controls on the MVP right-of- way were installed properly but that after the rains on May 15 to 19 the erosion controls \""disappeared.\"" Laurence Hammack, Construction halted at Mountain Valley Pipeline worksite following severe erosion in Franklin County, The Roanoke Times (May 20, 2018), http://www.roanoke.com/business/construction-halted-at-mountain-valley-pipeline-work-site- following-severe/article_2eeebd3a-5007-56b0-9469-3e381b09b668.html. Prior to the May 15 to 19 rainstorm, Mr. Flora inspected the easement adjacent to his hayfield and observed that MVP had placed only a few \""silt socks\""1 and some concrete barriers on the easement to control erosion. Both the concrete barriers and the silt socks proved ineffective in holding back the runoff from the easement near the Flora property. In fact, Mr. Flora observed sediment-laden water running around the concrete barriers on the easement.\nThese same controls were used on the easements adjacent to the Frith and Hurt properties. Again, and during a much less intense rainstorm, these erosion controls failed to prevent mud from covering the shared private driveway and the Frith and Hurt properties.\nDEQ has not required MVP to improve the erosion controls on MVP's easements since the rainstorms. DEQ levied no fines or penalties against MVP nor did it issue a formal stop-work order. DEQ has also not ordered MVP to reevaluate the use of certain erosion control mechanisms in light of their recent catastrophic failures and DEQ has not insisted that MVP use more stringent erosion control measures. Instead DEQ has publicly, and wrongly, stated that no sediment from the MVP easements reached any streams. But the eyewitness accounts of Plaintiffs, contemporaneous evidence recorded during the rainstorms, and DEQ internal emails show that sediment runoff into streams near MVP's easements was significant, widespread and nearly uncontrolled. An email from DEQ employee Elizabeth Abe to another DEQ employee Matthew Grant explains that while driving on Brick Church Road in Rocky Mount, Virginia she observed a stream so choked with mud from an MVP easement that water was not flowing through the stream. Ex. A. She also observed that MVP had failed to erect any erosion controls on its easement. Id.\nFor its part MVP has done little, if anything, to remedy the situation that led to large-scale mud deposition on Plaintiffs' properties. As of an inspection on May 28, 2018 MVP had not materially improved the erosion controls at any of the easements near Plaintiffs' properties. Silt fencing2 located on MVP easements near the Flora and Frith properties are riddled with holes and collapsing. Some of the ground underneath the silt fences has eroded away, leaving room for runoff to pass unimpeded underneath the fence. Silt socks on the same easements are only staked to the ground, not embedded in it, such that water may pass freely underneath them as well. Those areas also lack silt socks with enough height to prevent water from spilling over the top of them, especially where some already have mud built up on them. Proof of those conditions will be supported by testimony as to the personal observations of the Plaintiffs on their properties, as supported by photographs, videos, and water samples they took and/or collected. MVP constructed sediment dikes on some of the easements, but the dikes are not compacted and thus they themselves are susceptible to eroding away, completely nullifying their erosion prevention function. Moreover, the dikes are not seeded with grass mats, further adding to the likelihood that they will erode when it next rains. Silt socks placed in gaps in silt fencing and at the outlets of the dikes are secured only by stakes and are undermined by erosion in some places. The next significant rain will exploit the weaknesses in the erosion controls and lead to additional trespasses on Plaintiffs' properties. Neither DEQ nor MVP have addressed these weaknesses and trespasses will continue until MVP is enjoined to remedy those weaknesses.""}, {""heading"": ""I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits"", ""content"": ""Plaintiffs are likely to succeed the merits of their continuing trespass claim. MVP has shown that it has not been able to control the erosion and deposition of mud and soil from its easements onto Plaintiffs' properties, even during this early stage of construction. Even after its erosion controls failed on two separate occasions, MVP has not attempted to implement tighter controls or even fully repair the mediocre controls it has in place now. MVP's actions make it a near certainty that the next time there is a significant rain event, mud will erode from MVP's easements onto Plaintiffs' properties.\nVirginia common law defines trespass as \""an unauthorized entry onto property which results in interference with the property owner's possessory interests therein.\"" Kurpiel v. Hicks, 731 S.E.2d 921, 925 (Va. 2012) (quoting Cooper v. Horn, 448 S.E.2d 403, 406 (Va. 1994)). That means \""a plaintiff must prove an invasion that interfered with the right of exclusive possession of the land . . . that was a direct result of some act committed by the defendant.\"" Id.  Plaintiffs here seek only the vindication of the golden rule of property law: \""[t]he law requires that every person so use his own property as not to injure the property of another.\"" Cooper v. Horn, 448 S.E.2d 403, 407 (Va. 1994).\nThe power to exclude is one of the most treasured strands in an owner's bundle of property rights. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 435-36 (1982); Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143 (1978) (\""One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others.\""). Violations of this right include trespass. Virginia recognizes the \""general principle of law, [that] every person is entitled to the exclusive and peaceful enjoyment of his own land, and to redress if such enjoyment shall be wrongfully interrupted by another.\"" Tate v. Ogg, 195 S.E. 496, 498 (Va. 1938).\nAny physical entry upon the surface of the land constitutes such an invasion, whether the entry is \""a walking upon it, flooding it with water, casting objects upon it, or otherwise.\"" W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 13, at 70 (5th ed. 1984). Cooper v. Horn, 248 Va. at 423. Proof of negligence is not necessary. Id. at 424.\nThe Virginia Supreme Court has recognized on multiple occasions that any physical invasion is sufficient to succeed on a trespass claim. Id. This is the case \""whether the entry is a walking upon it, flooding it with water, casting objects upon it, or otherwise.\"" Id. A continuing trespass is a trespass that is \""committed by one against another [and] constantly repeated . . . .\"" Boerner v. McCallister, 89 S.E.2d 23, 25 (Va. 1955).\nMVP has already committed a trespass against Plaintiffs property rights in their individual properties, and it is extremely likely the MVP will continue to trespass on Plaintiffs' properties when it rains. In fact, MVP has failed to implement erosion controls in a proper manner. MVP has failed to compact its sediment dikes and failed to seed them with grass. MVP also placed silt socks that are inadequate to absorb or redirect the mud-laden flow they receive. Additionally, MVP failed to repair holes in its erosion control mechanisms and erosion underneath those mechanisms and continues to use installation techniques that do not ensure the effectiveness of those controls. DEQ, although lax in its enforcement, is not charged with enforcing trespass law.4 It is, nevertheless, disheartening that DEQ stands idle while MVP refuses to implement effective erosion controls. Further, DEQ's public assessments of the scope of the erosion control failures are undercut by the observations of its own employees. DEQ has shown that by those and other actions that Plaintiffs cannot to rely on the Commonwealth to adequately protect their property rights. Plaintiffs are forced, therefore, to bring this action to ensure that their most fundamental property rights will be protected from MVP's failure to take the care and spend the money necessary to prevent its trespasses.\nAs a result of MVP's slipshod attempt at erosion control and the lack of a plan to remedy the past failures of the same controls currently in place, MVP is nearly certain to continue to deposit mud and soil from its easements onto Plaintiffs' properties when it rains, thus constituting a continuing trespass on Plaintiffs' properties.""}, {""heading"": ""II. Imminent Irreparable Harm"", ""content"": ""Absent an injunction Plaintiffs will suffer imminent and irreparable injury. MVP has been unable to prevent mud from being deposited on Plaintiffs' property and has taken few, if any, steps to prevent any future trespass on Plaintiffs' properties.\nViolations of Plaintiffs' property rights constitute an irreparable injury under Virginia law. In holding that an injunction is the appropriate remedy for enforcement of real property rights, the Virginia Supreme Court explained that \""the violation of a real property interest is deemed irreparable and the owner protected in the enjoyment of his property whether such be sentimental or pecuniary.\"" Norfolk S. Ry. v. Breeden, 756 S.E.2d 420, 424-25 (Va. 2014) (quoting Levisa Coal Co. v. Consolidation Coal Co., 662 S.E.2d 44, 54 (Va. 2008)). In the case of a continuing trespass, as Plaintiffs claim here, the Defendant's were in compliance with DEQ's requirements, which it is not, such compliance would not affect its duty to also comply with its common law obligations.\ncontinuing trespass may be enjoined even though each individual act of trespass is in itself trivial, or the damage is trifling, nominal or insubstantial, and despite the fact that no single trespass causes irreparable injury. The injury is deemed irreparable and the owner protected in the enjoyment of his property whether such be sentimental or pecuniary.\nLevisa Coal, 662 S.E.2d at 54 (quoting Boerner, 89 S.E.2d at 25). This is so because \""where an injury by one against another is being constantly repeated, so that the complainant's remedy at law requires the bringing of successive actions, the legal remedy is inadequate, and the trespass will be prevented in equity by an injunction, the prevention of a multiplicity of actions at law being one of the special grounds of equity jurisdiction.\"" Boerner, 89 S.E.2d at 25. MVP's lack of effective erosion controls will likely result in future injuries to Plaintiffs' properties each time an appreciable amount of rain falls. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' injuries can only be remedied by an injunction barring future trespasses by MVP.""}, {""heading"": ""III. Balance of the Harms"", ""content"": ""The balance of harms in this case tips decidedly in favor of Plaintiffs.5 Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer violations of their property rights until MVP remedies its ineffective erosion controls. MVP's will suffer no harm whatsoever.\nMVP has violated and will continue to violate Plaintiffs' most fundamental property right: the right of exclusion. \""The explanation for the pervasive nature of the institution of [property rights] lies in the fundamental need, apparent across time and cultures, to separate me from thee.\"" Richard Epstein, Property as a Fundamental Civil Right, 29 Cal. W. Law Rev. 187, 188 (1992). It does Plaintiffs grievous harm for MVP to continue to infringe on this most basic of rights.\nBy contrast, MVP \""will suffer no harm by being enjoined from doing what the law already prohibits.\"" Solis v. Manalapan Mining Co., No. 10-115-GFVT, 2010 WL 2197534, at *6 (E.D. Ky. May 27, 2010). An injunction here would prevent MVP from trespassing on Plaintiffs' properties by requiring more stringent erosion controls. MVP is already barred from trespassing on property to which it has no rights. As a result, MVP \""can claim little or no harm from being ordered to simply comply with existing . . . law . . . .\"" Dunbar v. Landis Plastics, Inc., 996 F. Supp. 174, 181 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); see also Audi AG v. D'Amato, 469 F.3d 534, 550 (6th Cir. 2006) (\""In balancing the hardships between each party, we note that D'Amato faces no hardship in refraining from willful trademark infringement . . . .\""); Warner Bros. Entm't, Inc. v. Vega, No. 11- 05895(SPx), 2012 WL 13008442, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2012) (\""While Plaintiff will be harmed by continuing infringement, there appears to be no harm to Defendants . . . because an injunction would merely require Defendants to comply with the Copyright Act.\""); Microsoft Corp. v. McGee, 490 F. Supp. 2d 874, 883 (S.D. Ohio 2007).\nMeasured against the harm to Plaintiffs' foundational property rights, MVP can lay no claim to any harm over and above the \""harm\"" of complying with Virginia law. To argue otherwise would permit MVP to realize benefits from reduced costs of construction by transferring its costs onto Plaintiffs. Consequently, while Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer violations of their fundamental property rights without an injunction, MVP will merely suffer compliance with the law.""}, {""heading"": ""IV. The Public Interest"", ""content"": ""The public interest lies in protecting the property rights of Plaintiffs from continuing trespass by MVP. The right of exclusion and its necessary corollary, the enforcement of trespass by American courts. On the other hand, it would violate the public interest to allow MVP to push its costs of business onto innocent landowners throughout Virginia who are too often the unwilling neighbors of a bully set on trampling basic property rights for its private, and illegitimate gain.

In their motion, plaintiffs have made no attempt to identify what else needs to be done.  Plaintiffs want to enjoin a result-further discharges of surface water and sediment.

Even ultimate success on the merits may prove a little more than a hollow victory, unless a court requires the building to be destroyed.  While a court may award monetary damages for loss of profits, in most cases however, \""injunctive relief is a better remedy because it allows for continuation of the business operations pending a final adjudication on the merits.  Id. (emphasis added) (holding that temporary injunctive relief was a more appropriate remedy because it permitted the plaintiff to retain her customer base and continued to receive income from the business).  Real property is a unique interest as no two properties are alike, or to such interest is not readily measurable or fully compensable in damages.  See Kmart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., supra.\nAbsent intervention from this Court, construction of the building will permanently and materially obstruct the view of the Ingles store from adjacent roads and affect Sky King's rights under the Lease and future development of the shopping center.  As a result, Plaintiffs' careful planning regarding the location access and view of the Ingles store and other improvements in the shopping center will all be for naught.  Plaintiffs will not be able to maintain the center view site line, which is of major importance to it in selecting a building site for Ingles and most other potential future tenants. Furthermore, Plaintiffs will not benefit from its careful planning and having restrictions placed on the property so as to not impede the view of the Ingles store, which it bargained for but will not receive.  The obstruction will impair the value of its store, its ability to attract new customers, and the value of the premises under future leases for the space.  These injuries satisfy application of the irreparable harm standard.  It is essential, therefore, that the Court enjoin Defendants from continuing construction on the building to obstruct the view of the Ingles store, and which is in contravention of the restrictive covenants, which were placed on the property by virtue of, inter alia, the Declaration.""}, {""heading"": ""II.

Defendant Maria purportedly owns only Parcels 2 and 3; therefore, any argument that this restriction contemplated one building on multiple parcels is inapposite. Such a construction would make development of Parcel 1, which is not contiguous with Parcels 2 and 3, completely impossible. In addition, Restriction 5.3 references an attached \""Exhibit E.\""  Exhibit E (which allegedly was not attached to the filed document) clearly delineates the fact that the Declarationlimits development of Parcels 1, 2, or 3 to one building per parcel, and sets forth the location of each potential building.

Exhibit E, which is a depiction of Parcels 1, 2, and 3 taken directly from the approved site plan attached to the amendment to the Lease, shows clearly that a building spanning more than one lot is not allowed.

Development and use restrictions shall limit the construction to be performed on Parcels 1, 2, and 3 to the construction of one building of one story and no more than twenty-four (24) feet in height in the locations and with the requisite parking spaces, shown on Exhibit \""E\"" attached hereto.\nThe filed REA, however, contained no attached Exhibit \""E\"" and therefore Exhibit \""E\"" was not, and could not be found when the Akkarys performed a title search of the public record prior to purchasing the Subject Property from Jaylin Spartanburg.  Plaintiffs' Memorandum suggests that the Akkarys performed no further inquiry; however, this is far from the truth.  As set forth above, the Purchase Contract required Jaylin Spartanburg, as the seller, to provide copies of the documents in Jaylin Spartanburg's possession that pertained to the Subject Property.  In conjunction with the closing on the Subject Property (the \""Closing\""), the Akkarys' closing attorney interacted with Jaylin Spartanburg and its broker in an effort to obtain all relevant documents pertinent to the transaction.  The Akkarys' inquiry was more than reasonable given that Jaylin Spartanburg was not only the Seller under the Purchase Contract but also the Declarant under the REA.  In short, Jaylin Spartanburg was in the best position to have knowledge of any restrictions or limitations related to the Subject Property.   Despite the Akkarys' inquiry, Exhibit \""E\"" was never provided to the Akkarys or their attorney prior to the Closing nor did they ever receive confirmation of the existence of the same.  Additionally, the Seller's Affidavit, Certification and Acknowledgment, executed by Jaylin Spartanburg as part of the Closing, specifically provides that there are no liens, encumbrances, or easements against the Subject Property that were not disclosed on the closing statement, the deed and/or satisfied at closing.19\nThe Akkarys clearly performed the type of inquiry that would be conducted by a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser of commercial real estate.  They conducted a full title examination prior to purchasing the Subject Property and, through their attorney, followed up with Jaylin Spartanburg and/or its broker by requesting Jaylin Spartanburg and/or its broker to provide all pertinent documentation associated with the transaction.  The Akkarys took those steps that would be expected in such a circumstance.  To rule in favor of Plaintiffs on the constructive notice issue would change the landscape of real estate transactions in South Carolina and would be inconsistent with our system of record notice.20\nConversely, if anyone has failed to do their duty in this matter, it is not the Akkarys, but Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' predecessors in title.  Plaintiffs and/or their predecessors in title failed to secure the rights they now assert, failed to properly record the documentation necessary to put the public on notice of said rights and also failed to act in a timely manner once they knew or should have known of the sale of the Subject Property.  Specifically, the failures of Plaintiffs and/or its predecessors in title include but are not limited to the following:\na. failing to obtain and/or record an enforceable right of first refusal with regard to the Subject Property; b. failing to obtain and/or record an enforceable memorandum of its lease to provide notice to the world of its rights; c. failing to acquire the Subject Property from Jaylin Spartanburg despite having actual and/or constructive knowledge of Jaylin Spartanburg's desire to sell the same; d. failing to act in a timely manner after having actual or constructive notice of the Akkarys' purchase of the Subject Property; e. failing to act in accordance with the terms of the REA; f. failing to ensure that the purported Exhibit \""E\"" was attached to and recorded with the REA; and g. failing to provide the Akkarys and/or their closing attorney with a copy of the purported \""Exhibit E\"" prior to closing, after being asked by the Akkarys to provide all relevant documents associated with the closing.\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.""}, {""heading"": ""II.

Specifically, a Waffle House now exists on one of the outparcels identified in the purported Exhibit \""E\"" of the REA.  Likewise, Ingles constructed a gas station on the front portion of the Shopping Center property.  Both of these structures arguably obstruct visibility to the Ingles grocery store.  It is difficult to imagine that Defendant Maria's proposed construction would lead to irreparable harm for Plaintiffs.

Since the Akkary Family Businesses will not have a space to operate once the existing leases expire in September 2015, every day that construction cannot move forward threatens the future existence of the Akkarys Family Businesses and the livelihood of the families who work for those businesses. Any delay will not only put the Akkary Family Businesses at risk, but it will also cause Defendant Maria to suffer economic losses associated with its lender and increased costs associated with construction delays.  Defendant Maria has also entered into agreements with two separate tenants who intend to occupy two of the retail spaces in the new structure to be constructed on the Subject Property.  Delaying the construction will prevent Defendant Maria from being able to comply with the agreements with these proposed tenants and would deny Defendant Maria the rent payments to which it would otherwise be entitled.

The Akkarys acted as a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser would act and therefore satisfied their duties under the doctrine of constructive notice.  To hold that the Akkarys had constructive notice of the applicable restrictions under such circumstances would have the effect of altering South Carolina's well-established law of record notice.

Initially, Defendant Maria would note that the proposed construction on the Subject Property is consistent with the limitations contained in the recorded REA and would simply not obstruct the \""center view corridor\"" of the Ingles grocery store.\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs' emphasis on the importance of visibility is undermined by the fact that Plaintiffs and/or Plaintiffs' predecessors in title have permitted the development of outparcels.  Specifically, a Waffle House now exists on one of the outparcels identified in the purported Exhibit \""E\"" of the REA.  Likewise, Ingles constructed a gas station on the front portion of the Shopping Center property.  Both of these structures arguably obstruct visibility to the Ingles grocery store.  It is difficult to imagine that Defendant Maria's proposed construction would lead to irreparable harm for Plaintiffs.  Additionally, it seems that having two additional businesses in the shopping center would increase traffic to the shopping center as a whole and thereby lead to an increase in business at the Ingles store as well.  This also casts doubt on Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants' proposed construction would lead to irreparable harm for Plaintiffs.\nIn contrast, however, the Defendants would truly face irreparable harm if the injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs is granted.   Plaintiffs' Memorandum correctly states that Bill Akkary is presently operating two businesses in the Ingles shopping center as a tenant and that the Akkarys plan to move these two businesses to the building currently being constructed by Defendant Maria on the Subject Property.  However, Plaintiffs' Memorandum fails to mention that the current leases for the Akkary Family Businesses expire in September 2015.   Plaintiffs are clearly aware of the terms of the leases related to the Akkary Family Businesses as Plaintiff Sky King, Inc. (an alter ego of Ingles) now owns the Shopping Center.

Prior to beginning construction, Maria was on notice that it could not construct one building on the two parcels it purportedly owns.  The Declaration of Reciprocal Easement, filed in the RMC Office on June 10, 2002, provides as follows:\n5.3 Restrictions Relating to Development. Development and use restrictions shall limit the construction to be performed on Parcels 1, 2, and 3 to the construction of one building of one story and no more than twenty-four (24) feet in height in the locations and with the requisite parking spaces, shown on \""Exhibit E\"" attached hereto.\nThus, the Declaration by its terms limits construction on Parcels 1, 2, or 3 to one building per parcel. Defendant Maria purportedly owns only Parcels 2 and 3; therefore, any argument that this restriction contemplated one building on multiple parcels is inapposite. Such a construction would make development of Parcel 1, which is not contiguous with Parcels 2 and 3, completely impossible. In addition, Restriction 5.3 references an attached \""Exhibit E.\""  Exhibit E (which allegedly was not attached to the filed document) clearly delineates the fact that the Declarationlimits development of Parcels 1, 2, or 3 to one building per parcel, and sets forth the location of each potential building.  Even if the exhibit was not attached to the Declaration, Defendant Maria was on notice to inquire about Exhibit E's contents.\nIn the context of a real estate transaction, constructive or inquiry notice arises when a party becomes aware or should have become aware of certain facts, which, if investigated, will reveal the claim of another.

Exhibit E, which is a depiction of Parcels 1, 2, and 3 taken directly from the approved site plan attached to the amendment to the Lease, shows clearly that a building spanning more than one lot is not allowed.

In such circumstances, South Carolina caselaw has emphasized that the standard which applies is the type of investigation that would be conducted by a \""reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser.\"" Id. at 120, 628 S.E.2d at 876.\nAs set forth in Plaintiffs' Memorandum, the REA includes the following provision: 5.3   Restrictions Relating to Development.  Development and use restrictions shall limit the construction to be performed on Parcels 1, 2, and 3 to the construction of one building of one story and no more than twenty-four (24) feet in height in the locations and with the requisite parking spaces, shown on Exhibit \""E\"" attached hereto.\nThe filed REA, however, contained no attached Exhibit \""E\"" and therefore Exhibit \""E\"" was not, and could not be found when the Akkarys performed a title search of the public record prior to purchasing the Subject Property from Jaylin Spartanburg.  Plaintiffs' Memorandum suggests that the Akkarys performed no further inquiry; however, this is far from the truth.  As set forth above, the Purchase Contract required Jaylin Spartanburg, as the seller, to provide copies of the documents in Jaylin Spartanburg's possession that pertained to the Subject Property.  In conjunction with the closing on the Subject Property (the \""Closing\""), the Akkarys' closing attorney interacted with Jaylin Spartanburg and its broker in an effort to obtain all relevant documents pertinent to the transaction.  The Akkarys' inquiry was more than reasonable given that Jaylin Spartanburg was not only the Seller under the Purchase Contract but also the Declarant under the REA.  In short, Jaylin Spartanburg was in the best position to have knowledge of any restrictions or limitations related to the Subject Property.   Despite the Akkarys' inquiry, Exhibit \""E\"" was never provided to the Akkarys or their attorney prior to the Closing nor did they ever receive confirmation of the existence of the same.  Additionally, the Seller's Affidavit, Certification and Acknowledgment, executed by Jaylin Spartanburg as part of the Closing, specifically provides that there are no liens, encumbrances, or easements against the Subject Property that were not disclosed on the closing statement, the deed and/or satisfied at closing.19\nThe Akkarys clearly performed the type of inquiry that would be conducted by a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser of commercial real estate.  They conducted a full title examination prior to purchasing the Subject Property and, through their attorney, followed up with Jaylin Spartanburg and/or its broker by requesting Jaylin Spartanburg and/or its broker to provide all pertinent documentation associated with the transaction.  The Akkarys took those steps that would be expected in such a circumstance.  To rule in favor of Plaintiffs on the constructive notice issue would change the landscape of real estate transactions in South Carolina and would be inconsistent with our system of record notice.20\nConversely, if anyone has failed to do their duty in this matter, it is not the Akkarys, but Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' predecessors in title.  Plaintiffs and/or their predecessors in title failed to secure the rights they now assert, failed to properly record the documentation necessary to put the public on notice of said rights and also failed to act in a timely manner once they knew or should have known of the sale of the Subject Property.  Specifically, the failures of Plaintiffs and/or its predecessors in title include but are not limited to the following:\na. failing to obtain and/or record an enforceable right of first refusal with regard to the Subject Property; b. failing to obtain and/or record an enforceable memorandum of its lease to provide notice to the world of its rights; c. failing to acquire the Subject Property from Jaylin Spartanburg despite having actual and/or constructive knowledge of Jaylin Spartanburg's desire to sell the same; d. failing to act in a timely manner after having actual or constructive notice of the Akkarys' purchase of the Subject Property; e. failing to act in accordance with the terms of the REA; f. failing to ensure that the purported Exhibit \""E\"" was attached to and recorded with the REA; and g. failing to provide the Akkarys and/or their closing attorney with a copy of the purported \""Exhibit E\"" prior to closing, after being asked by the Akkarys to provide all relevant documents associated with the closing.\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits."", ""score"": 0.7614614866510556}, {""moving_heading"": ""IV.

The Akkarys acted as a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser would act and therefore satisfied their duties under the doctrine of constructive notice.  To hold that the Akkarys had constructive notice of the applicable restrictions under such circumstances would have the effect of altering South Carolina's well-established law of record notice.  Purchasers of  residential and commercial real estate would not be entitled to rely on disclosures made by sellers and would be forced to exhibit a level of scrutiny that would go far beyond the current standards of real estate practice in this state.  Such a ruling could potentially have a chilling effect on the purchase of real estate, as buyers could feel that they might end up facing the burden of any errors or omissions made by the Seller during the closing process.  It would also send a message to sellers of real estate in this state that they can afford to be lax in the preparation and recordation of their documents, as they will ultimately be protected from their own negligence at the buyer's expense.\nIt is also incredibly significant that there are currently eight (8) vacant bays in the Plaintiffs' Shopping Center.   Plaintiffs are aware of this fact and are now seeking this Court's protection from legal and fair competition.
